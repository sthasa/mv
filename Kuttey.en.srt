1
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,083
{\an8}<i>Why do you do all this?</i>

2
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,000
{\an8}<i>There's no other way.</i>

3
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,208
{\an8}<i>For what?</i>

4
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:52,708
BHAMRAGAD POLICE STATION,
GADCHIROLI DISTRICT

5
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:54,916
Freedom.

6
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:00,000
Freedom! From whom?

7
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:04,083
From you and your masters.

8
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,666
Oh, so you want freedom from the country?

9
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,875
Only you and your master
do not make up the country.

10
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:14,875
We do, too.

11
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,041
So we want freedom

12
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,125
not from the country,
but from people like you.

13
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,541
So you think you can get freedom

14
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,333
by taking up arms
and killing innocents in your jungle?

15
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:36,958
Sardar...

16
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,625
You think the jungle is my home, right?

17
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,583
So here's a rule of the jungle.

18
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:51,541
You're either the hunter...
Or the hunted.

19
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,666
Long time ago,
there was a very hungry lion.

20
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:04,375
Whenever he would go on a hunt,
the prey would run away.

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,583
So he asked a goat and a dog for help

22
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,833
and all three of them
finally caught a prey.

23
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:22,166
The lion asked the goat to divide
the catch into three equal parts.

24
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,958
The goat did the same with fine precision
and presented it to the lion.

25
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,541
The lion turned red with anger

26
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,458
and devoured the goat.

27
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,583
Then, he turned to the dog and said...

28
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:49,041
"Now you divide the catch
into two equal halves."

29
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:55,166
The dog immediately turned over
the whole catch to the lion

30
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,666
and started gnawing
at the bones of the goat.

31
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,416
The lion's eyes welled up
with tears of joy.

32
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,625
He said in an overwhelmed voice...

33
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,291
"It is rightly said!"

34
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,875
"No one can beat a dog at loyalty."

35
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,708
Do you get it, Sardar?

36
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,125
We are the proverbial goat.

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,083
You are the dog.

38
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,166
And the lion is your master.

39
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,208
Hey, Sardar!

40
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,416
What the...

41
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,916
{\an8}A blanket, cigarette...

42
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:53,458
{\an8}What's all this?
Getting naughty under the sheets?

43
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,458
Feeling sorry...

44
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,708
{\an8}Feeling sorry for her?

45
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,541
{\an8}Son of a gun.

46
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:06,625
{\an8}You bloody...
Take this off! Motherfucker...

47
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:10,958
{\an8}Boss.

48
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,791
{\an8}Want a go at her?

49
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,000
No...

50
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,916
I'll rot if I touch her.

51
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:23,083
{\an8}- Boss! Come.
- Sir...

52
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,875
{\an8}- Boss.
- Sir...

53
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,625
This isn't right.

54
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,416
This isn't right, sir.

55
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:39,750
{\an8}Motherfucker, you want to teach me
what's wrong and right?

56
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:43,708
{\an8}You want to teach me?
Fucker...

57
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,333
You want to teach me?

58
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,666
{\an8}You bloody!

59
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,291
I'll take her.
Rotten works for me!

60
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,458
Tie her up!

61
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:14,166
<i>Freedom!
Freedom!</i>

62
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:20,083
<i>Freedom!
Freedom!</i>

63
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:25,833
<i>From starvation, from cruelty,
The dying peasants ask for freedom!</i>

64
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,625
<i>Freedom!</i>

65
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:34,375
<i>Freedom!
Freedom!</i>

66
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,791
<i>From tyranny, this doomed life,
The unjust law</i>

67
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:42,958
<i>They ask for freedom!</i>

68
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:48,666
<i>Freedom!
Freedom!</i>

69
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,458
<i>- We'll fight for...
- Freedom!</i>

70
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,291
<i>- We'll die for...
- Freedom!</i>

71
00:06:54,416 --> 00:07:00,583
<i>We'll snatch our freedom
If we don't get it!</i>

72
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:11,791
<i>Freedom!
Freedom!</i>

73
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:17,500
<i>Freedom!

<i>Freedom!

00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:28,750
<i>Freedom!

76
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:43,958
Shankar!

77
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:07,666
<i>Freedom!
Freedom!</i>

78
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:12,250
<i>Freedom!
Freedom!</i>

79
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,833
Long live the revolution!

80
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,958
{\an8}Leave him.

81
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,541
{\an8}Bomb...

82
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:56,708
If you ever want liberation
from oppression, use this.

83
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:36,541
THERE IS ONLY ONE GOD

84
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,833
How much does Surti pay?

85
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:11,333
Surti? No, Boss, you're mistaken.

86
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,250
We don't work for Surti.

87
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:37,125
Why is his coke cheaper
than mine in the market?

88
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:43,083
Boss, I don't drink Pepsi
nor do I make Coke...

89
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,958
How would I know?

90
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,791
Neither Pepsi nor Coke?

91
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,416
No, Boss.

92
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,666
Fanta?

93
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,625
Gold Spot? Mangola?
Double-seven?

94
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,375
- No, Boss.
- What else do you make?

95
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,208
A jackass?

96
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:05,916
Boss... Why would we lie to you?

97
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,875
Boss, Boss, Boss...

98
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,166
Lower the guns.

99
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,833
Boss, please tell them
to put the guns away!

100
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,083
Lower the guns. Let's talk.
Please, Boss!

101
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,333
Where do the Nigerians
get their coke from?

102
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,958
Nairobi... They get it from Nairobi.

103
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,041
How?

104
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,750
By hiding it up their ass.

105
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,333
Yes.

106
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,166
What's your share every month?

107
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,750
Boss...

108
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,791
No, Boss.

109
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,750
Okay, Boss, I'll tell you.
Boss, Boss... Rs. 2,00,000!

110
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,500
We get Rs. 2,00,000 every month, Boss.

111
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,500
Sir, you told me you get Rs. 1,00,000.

112
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,416
Paaji!

113
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,583
The fucker is lying.
He actually gets paid Rs. 3,00,000.

114
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:04,333
No. Last month, he gave me Rs. 3 lakh.
It was Rs. 2 lakh before that.

115
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,833
What do we do with him?

116
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,416
Shoot him.

117
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,875
No, Boss! Boss!
Boss, please don't kill me...

118
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,708
Boss, I swear! I'll do as you say.

119
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,208
Boss, Boss...

120
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,541
Are you up for sale?

121
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,375
Sold!

122
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:24,791
Sold!

123
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:27,958
For how much?

124
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:33,041
Surti didn't just screw my business,
but my reputation too.

125
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,541
I'll pay whatever you ask for,
to kill him.

126
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,291
Ah! Thank you, Surti.

127
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,208
Have this.

128
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,541
Try it.

129
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,375
Delicious.

130
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,333
What's it called?

131
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,583
<i>Khandvi</i>...

132
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,250
<i>Khand</i>...

133
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,458
- <i>Vi</i>... <i>Khandvi!</i>
- <i>Khandvi</i>... Makes sense.

134
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,583
- It's a Gujarati roll, you know?
- Got it.

135
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,375
Paaji, listen.

136
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,708
I'll take down Surti and the blacks.

137
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,666
You bump off the rest.

138
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,208
Sir, can I take down Surti?

139
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,541
Why?

140
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,291
Over the last five years,

141
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,125
he's made me eat so much shit

142
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,541
that my stomach has almost become
a mine for oil and natural gas.

143
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,083
He has left me
with permanent acidity, sir.

144
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,500
I'll be the one to kill him.

145
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,458
- <i>Phoolwadi</i>... Flower.
- Can I try it?

146
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,791
- Good, no?
- It's all veg right? No meat?

147
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,833
There is meat.

148
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,666
There.

149
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,750
Hey, people!

150
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,958
- Let's go, sir?
- It's not twelve yet.

151
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,333
What will happen at twelve?

152
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,041
I have to break my fast.

153
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,583
It's a Tuesday.

154
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,875
Wait...

155
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,291
- Shall we, Paaji?
- Yes.

156
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,500
Gopal, are you alright?

157
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,708
Well...

158
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,666
<i>Stray dogs are astray!</i>

159
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,833
<i>Stray dogs are astray!</i>

160
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:35,791
<i>A bite here, a bark there!</i>

161
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:40,333
<i>Pounce at whatever comes their way!</i>

162
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,666
<i>Stray dogs are astray!</i>

163
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:50,458
<i>Stray dogs are astray!</i>

164
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,583
Don't kill me, man.
I saved your life! Please!

165
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,750
My gun...

166
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,416
Bring it. Fast!

167
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,166
Fast.

168
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:32,541
Please, come on, man.
Okay. Come on, man, please...

169
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,166
Look, look, you can have whatever...
You can take the drugs if you want.

170
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,333
Sir, let's not get involved
in this shit...

171
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,125
Are you crazy?

172
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,083
Should we just leave the stuff
worth two crores?

173
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,333
We're already getting two
for killing Surti.

174
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,041
So? Is there a problem
if we make two more?

175
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,458
If we leave the drugs here,

176
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,541
everyone will think the deal between
Surti and the Nigerians went wrong,

177
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,000
and that a shootout ensued.

178
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,125
Everything will be clean, sir.
Please, listen to me.

179
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,625
And what about him?

180
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,916
Kill him.

181
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,166
What is he saying?

182
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,166
He is asking me to kill you.

183
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,416
What the fuck? Why?
What did I do to you?

184
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,125
Sir, what are you doing?

185
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,041
- Paaji, why would you want me killed?
- No!

186
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,083
Listen, please...

187
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,458
Sir, if we spare him, we'll get screwed.

188
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,166
- I'll take the first flight out of India.
- No way!

189
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,833
Okay, look, I promise
I'll be on my first flight out of India.

190
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,250
Sir, if we spare him we're screwed.

191
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,750
- Please, sir.
- Sir, shoot!

192
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,833
Hey, let go of me!
Let go!

193
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:13,541
Look, Paaji, I did what you asked.

194
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:18,750
So now you will have to do what I ask.

195
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,333
Pick up the bags.

196
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:27,291
- Sir...
- Pick it up before I shoot you!

197
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,458
How long will you stay upset,
my millionaire friend?

198
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,416
Smile a little.

199
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,250
Didn't you learn how to swim
while training, sir?

200
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,416
Swimming? No.
I learned how to soar.

201
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,833
ID, please.

202
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:30,583
<i>Cunning eyes
Your cunning eyes</i>

203
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:35,500
<i>Like shards of glass...
Cunning eyes...</i>

204
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,916
<i>I can understand why he did it.</i>

205
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,666
But you've spent your whole life
on the force, Paaji.

206
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,541
Yet you did something like this?

207
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:50,208
Sir, we were undercover there.

208
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,166
{\an8}Oh, is it!

209
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,541
{\an8}Who assigned you this undercover job?

210
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,250
{\an8}Your DCP?

211
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:59,750
{\an8}The Commissioner?

212
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:03,083
{\an8}The Home Secretary?
Or the Chief Minister himself?

213
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:10,666
Sir, the matter was a little sensitive
so we didn't tell anyone.

214
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,333
{\an8}I'm telling you the truth, sir.

215
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:16,875
{\an8}Lad, the truth is that
we found drugs in your car.

216
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:29,125
{\an8}You took money
for the hit on Surti, right?

217
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:32,750
- Come on...
- Should I also reveal

218
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:33,875
who ordered the hit?

219
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:35,250
No, sir. This wasn't a hit...

220
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,083
{\an8}Thanks to your shitty luck,

221
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,708
{\an8}Surti took four bullets
and fell off the roof

222
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,458
but still survived.

223
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:49,791
Just pray that he doesn't come out
of the coma.

224
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:54,791
{\an8}Otherwise, you'll lose your heads
along with your jobs.

225
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,458
Did you get the money yet?

226
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:11,958
This is what happens
when you try to ride two horses at once.

227
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:18,833
Paaji!

228
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,666
Manohar! What are you doing here?

229
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,083
I am his driver nowadays.

230
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:30,583
I heard about your suspension.

231
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:33,250
Remember Ms. Pammi?

232
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,625
- Poonam Sandhu...
- Yes.

233
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,625
She's the Commissioner's
favorite these days.

234
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:43,291
She's posted in Navi Mumbai.

235
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:46,833
She handles all of his dealings too.

236
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,125
See you.

237
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,416
{\an8}<i>Early morning,</i>

238
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:59,250
<i>chilly as hell...</i>

239
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,666
<i>Remember?</i>

240
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:05,500
The living room was empty...

241
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,625
The bedroom was empty, too.

242
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,291
We thought he had run away.

243
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:18,666
But just then I heard a loud noise
from the toilet.

244
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,625
The door was unlocked.

245
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:31,666
I opened it and there he was, reading
a newspaper sitting on the toilet.

246
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:37,375
Just as he tried to get up,
I pumped three slugs into him...

247
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:38,958
Bang! Bang! Bang!

248
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:41,833
He sat back down on the toilet.

249
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:47,666
And then, his soul left his body
through his ass

250
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:51,291
towards the Grim Reaper, screaming...

251
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:56,875
Correct.

252
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:03,750
Those were the days, Paaji! Such fun!

253
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:07,291
These are the days, too, Ms. Pammi,
to slog.

254
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:14,583
But the thrill of being
a police inspector is gone now.

255
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:17,083
Now I've got responsibilities.

256
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:19,833
I mean...

257
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,083
Are you married yet?

258
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,125
Marriage?

259
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:27,083
Nice example.

260
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:29,250
So, are you?

261
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:32,041
No, Paaji.

262
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:39,125
The One above has stopped
making men lately, Paaji.

263
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:43,875
Now it's just small dumb fucks,
big dumb fucks,

264
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:47,083
or mega dumb fucks
that He sends into the world.

265
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:53,791
If a lion is thirsty...

266
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:59,583
It won't fucking drink poison, right?

267
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:10,375
Mr. Madam, we went to see Mr. Rajiv
a few days ago.

268
00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:15,125
He was saying there's no hope.

269
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,166
Think of him as a newlywed.

270
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:21,791
He thinks he'll be faithful
to his wife forever.

271
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,791
I've spoken to the higher-ups.

272
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:27,041
Your issue can be sorted.

273
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:28,333
How much will it cost?

274
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,541
There is but one God.

275
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:36,291
One? For both?

276
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:38,958
No.

277
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:41,875
One for one, two for two...

278
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,666
Who is that?

279
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:54,916
Fucker, there's a public toilet
ten feet away!

280
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:56,250
Can't you see?

281
00:27:56,375 --> 00:28:00,041
No! But I can smell it
from ten miles away.

282
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:02,875
Shut up and get out of here.

283
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,083
Am I pissing in your van?

284
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:10,208
Mr. Madam...

285
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:12,958
- What did you say? Son of a...
- Why you...

286
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,166
Harry!

287
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:17,416
- Pammi!
- Hey!

288
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:20,666
- At least wash your hands!
- It's clean.

289
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:23,000
- After all these years!
- Right, Harry.

290
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,625
Come, let's have a drink
for old times' sake.

291
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:27,541
No way, I'm on duty right now.

292
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,458
So do I look like I'm here on vacation?

293
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:33,791
- Come on.
- I've got company in the van.

294
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:38,041
Think of it as a dinner break.
We'll order some food for them too.

295
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:40,375
- You won't listen.
- Hey, Ramesh!

296
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,250
Come here.

297
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:46,000
- How many in the van?
- Four.

298
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:52,666
Send some chicken starters and <i>Biryani</i>
for the folks in that van.

299
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,083
You haven't changed at all.

300
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:56,833
- Come on.
- Okay.

301
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:58,583
Come on.

302
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:00,291
You haven't changed one bit.

303
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:04,541
- Nice, right?
- I know.

304
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,333
This is Paaji... My old colleague.

305
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,375
And this is Murli.

306
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,791
- It's Gopal, Mr. Madam. Gopal Tiwari...
- Gopal.

307
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:16,125
Gopal. Sorry.

308
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:18,750
Both are suspended right now.

309
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:21,375
- Really?
- Yes.

310
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:25,708
And this, the apple of my eye, Harry.

311
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:27,250
Harry.

312
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:29,625
He was on the force,
retired two years ago.

313
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:32,833
And what he does now,
even I don't know.

314
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,375
Oh, it's nothing.

315
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:36,916
- I'm into private security.
- Hmm?

316
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:39,750
For this company called Transecure.

317
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,791
That bank company?

318
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:44,958
We handle ATM deliveries for them.

319
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:48,083
How's the salary?

320
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:50,583
Way better than the force.

321
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,375
And the risk?

322
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:59,708
An automatic for a few lakhs?

323
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,583
Not lakhs, it's crores!

324
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:08,333
We load cash in all the ATMs
from Chembur to Panvel.

325
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:10,041
Every night.

326
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,708
- God.
- Sleepless and tired.

327
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:14,000
- Right.
- Leave it.

328
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:16,416
Tell me a joke.

329
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:18,916
- That Goa one?
- No. Something new. Fresh.

330
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:21,583
Okay. Here's a fresh and hot one.

331
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:25,500
One river, two lovers...

332
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,500
- One river, two lovers...
- Nice.

333
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:34,333
The male scorpion on one side

334
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,166
and the female on the other.

335
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:41,000
- Now how would they unite?
- Okay...

336
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:48,041
And then, the male scorpion saw a frog
on his side.

337
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:51,750
- Okay.
- He requested the frog,

338
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:57,375
"Please take me to the other side,
I'll forever be grateful."

339
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:02,125
The frog hesitated a bit

340
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:06,500
and asked,
"What if you sting me on the way?"

341
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:08,000
- Correct.
- Isn't it?

342
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,791
The scorpion burst out laughing,

343
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,791
and said, "Are you crazy?

344
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:14,833
Use some logic.

345
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:18,333
If I sting you,
then I'll drown along with you!"

346
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:23,041
- Correct.
- "I'm begging you, please take me

347
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:25,791
or my Juliet will give up on me."

348
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:31,583
The frog felt bad for the scorpion.

349
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:38,083
He let the scorpion climb on his back
and jumped into the river.

350
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:42,166
They must've reached halfway

351
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:49,958
when the frog felt like someone had put
a burning hot rocket up his ass.

352
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:57,708
First, the hot and heavy venom
of the scorpion...

353
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:04,291
And then, the cold intoxication of death.

354
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,250
The frog was left astounded.

355
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,250
With his last breath he asked,

356
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:14,458
"What is the logic behind this, pal?"

357
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:18,291
The scorpion muttered back

358
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:20,291
and said...

359
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:28,291
"Fuck the logic,
this is my character!"

360
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:31,958
My character...

361
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,875
His character!

362
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:39,125
Character...
What? Fuck the character?

363
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,583
Right!

364
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:44,000
- No, no! Fuck the logic.
- Fuck the logic!

365
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:47,333
- I said character!
- Right!

366
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:51,708
The scorpion got screwed.
Sorry... The frog!

367
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,750
- Character...
- His character.

368
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:00,500
- Fuck the logic.
- Fuck the logic.

369
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:02,000
Sir!

370
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,083
Mr. Gopal!

371
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,208
Sir, how do I manage one crore?

372
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:11,125
Do I look like Google
that you're asking for suggestions?

373
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:12,833
Do something...

374
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:15,666
Shoot yourself in the head.
Everything will be sorted.

375
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:19,875
Sir, I told you to leave the drugs.

376
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,333
But you didn't listen.

377
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,000
If I go down, I'll take you with me.

378
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:30,375
What did you say?

379
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:40,000
What did you say?

380
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,125
I will become a government witness!

381
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:54,958
Are you threatening me?

382
00:33:56,833 --> 00:34:01,458
If I want,
I can pin the whole thing on you!

383
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:12,833
The whole station is with me.

384
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:19,583
One signal and they will testify
against you in court.

385
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:28,000
Asshole.

386
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,416
Pull over.

387
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:57,291
- Vivek!
- Say it again, asshole!

388
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:59,125
Vivek! Vivek...

389
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:07,333
Is this what you learn in school?

390
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:11,500
What will you do when you grow up?
Become a gangster?

391
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:13,791
Have you no shame!

392
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,625
Fighting on the streets like a stray dog!

393
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,916
I didn't start the fight, Dad!

394
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:21,791
I've been tolerating it for a while.

395
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,250
But today, I couldn't.

396
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:29,708
He said, "Your dad will get fired
from his job.

397
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,500
So sell this medal

398
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:35,750
before the government takes it back."

399
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:50,875
Is this a reason to pick fights? Huh?

400
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:58,750
Dad, are you really going
to lose your job?

401
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:04,916
Have you lost your mind?

402
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,291
Why would I lose my job?

403
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,750
Silly boy!

404
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:57,500
Whatever we get above one crore
will be split equally between you all.

405
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:03,291
Mr. Gopal, I'll do anything for you.
I mean it!

406
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:10,208
What?

407
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,875
- What the fuck are you thinking about?
- Yes, sweetie?

408
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,666
- <i>Papa, where are you?</i>
- I'm at work. I'll be home late.

409
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:20,833
- Go to bed, okay?
- <i>No, not until you sing me a lullaby.</i>

410
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:23,083
Forgot about the Kurla encounter?

411
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,333
- If it weren't for Mr. Gopal...
- Okay, fine.

412
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:27,541
...you would've been hanged
for that kid's murder.

413
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:32,458
- <i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star!</i>
- Motherfucker! Speak up.

414
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:35,166
<i>How I wonder what you are...</i>

415
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:38,666
Sorry, Mr. Gopal. I am with you.

416
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:43,916
- <i>Like a diamond in the sky!</i>
- Sir...

417
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:47,250
<i>Yay! Goodnight, Papa!</i>

418
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:48,541
Goodnight, sweetheart!

419
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:56,083
Sir, we can't use our weapons or bullets.

420
00:38:56,958 --> 00:39:00,416
Then how do we pull this off?

421
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:04,083
Everything's been arranged.
It's in the jeep.

422
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,833
There is at least four crores in the van.

423
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,750
Do I need to tell you separately?

424
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:17,583
Should I give it in writing now?

425
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:20,541
We said we are in.

426
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:24,708
<i>With his last breath he asked...</i>

427
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:27,083
<i>What is the logic behind this, pal?</i>

428
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:29,333
<i>The scorpion muttered back...</i>

429
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:33,958
<i>Fuck the logic, this is my character!</i>

430
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,708
Logic...

431
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:47,666
Isn't that Gopal?

432
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,458
Who? The one who's waving?

433
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:52,000
Wasn't he suspended?

434
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:55,083
Yes, that's Gopal.

435
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:58,208
Keep the engine running.

436
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:06,541
Gopal!

437
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:08,458
What's the matter?

438
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:10,416
Is Pammi with you?

439
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,708
Oh, fuck!

440
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:13,333
Motherfucker!

441
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:39,875
{\an8}Sir! Sir! It has caught fire!
Run! Run!

442
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,666
Go! Run away!
Listen to me!

443
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:58,583
What are you doing?
No, no, not that way!

444
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:06,708
What are you looking at?

445
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:09,708
You won't get away, mother...

446
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:18,666
- Sir! Sir! Sir, please...
- Open it.

447
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:21,666
Sir, I only have one key.
The other one is with Samar.

448
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:24,083
- Samar who?
- The one who just ran out.

449
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,583
Deshpande, go check!

450
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:29,041
Please don't kill me, sir,
I have two younger siblings...

451
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:30,875
My family needs me, sir.

452
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,833
Sir, please!

453
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:34,708
Shut up!

454
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:38,125
I said shut up.

455
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,458
Get down!

456
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,291
Deshpande!

457
00:42:43,416 --> 00:42:46,000
- No, sir.
- Fuck! Deshpande!

458
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:47,333
Sir, please!

459
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:06,458
<i>They're from the bloody streets!</i>

460
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:13,000
<i>They pounce and they bark!</i>

461
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:16,791
<i>Dogs!</i>

462
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:19,583
<i>Dogs!</i>

463
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:26,416
Stop! Stop, please!

464
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:29,375
Stop, mister! Please!

465
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:31,750
Stop, please!

466
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,916
Please! Stop, mister!

467
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:38,791
Get off!

468
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:41,958
Move! Move!

469
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:47,125
Get lost, asshole!

470
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:51,583
Stop, please...

471
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:54,041
Hey! Stop! Stop!

472
00:43:58,291 --> 00:44:01,416
Stop crying! He's still alive!

473
00:44:18,666 --> 00:44:21,125
Pal, let's just leave!

474
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:24,875
Samar! Listen! Samar...

475
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:26,875
If we spare him, we're doomed.

476
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:44,041
Sorry, sir! I screwed up.

477
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:48,666
I'm not doing anything. Please, sir!

478
00:44:48,791 --> 00:44:50,750
Don't shoot me, sir.

479
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:51,791
Shut up!

480
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:54,583
Shut up!

481
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:55,833
Don't kill me, please.

482
00:44:55,958 --> 00:44:57,041
Shut up!

483
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:02,125
Get up.

484
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:10,750
Get inside.

485
00:45:16,416 --> 00:45:20,875
Hello! Some fuckers ambushed us
and stole the van!

486
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,250
They're heading towards you! Stop them!

487
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:27,708
Stop them, I'm coming as well!

488
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,166
Stop them!

489
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:36,458
Two kilometers from here,
you'll see a dirt road on the right.

490
00:45:40,916 --> 00:45:45,125
Sir, you won't kill me, right?

491
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:46,625
No.

492
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:48,625
Promise me.

493
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:56,916
Once we reach the location,
I'll take the money and we all go home.

494
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:58,958
LET'S GO TO CANADA?

495
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:15,416
Boss, Gopal is here.

496
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,666
The sub-inspector.

497
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:21,958
We attacked them, Boss.

498
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:24,000
We even killed ten of his men.

499
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:26,708
But the one you were supposed to kill
is still alive.

500
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,250
His luck was good, Boss,
and ours was bad.

501
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,125
I'm screwed from all sides.

502
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:37,875
I didn't get paid for the hit
and I also got suspended.

503
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:40,541
You also made us look like fools.
What about that?

504
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:44,833
I'll be fired, Boss.

505
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:47,583
I might go to jail, too.

506
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:52,250
If they torture me in there
and I spill the beans...

507
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:53,916
Are you threatening us, asshole?

508
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
No.

509
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:58,708
I'm asking for help!

510
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:07,833
What do you want?

511
00:48:09,708 --> 00:48:10,833
One crore.

512
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:16,791
I've not come to ask for money.
I'll arrange that.

513
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:21,375
I just need some weapons and bullets.

514
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:23,875
- Dad!
- Hmm.

515
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:27,166
Oh, my kitten!

516
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,666
Where are you going all dressed up?

517
00:48:29,833 --> 00:48:32,083
Vashi. It's my friend's birthday.

518
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:34,500
Vashi? At this hour?

519
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:38,875
Yeah! That big-shot designer
will be there as well.

520
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,750
I'll speak to him about
my wedding dress, too.

521
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:43,750
What time will you come back?

522
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:46,250
I'll stay over at my friend's.

523
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:48,000
No! You're getting married
in two weeks.

524
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,000
So?

525
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:54,000
Dad?

526
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,166
Okay, fine. Go.

527
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:01,291
But Daanish will go with you.

528
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:03,625
Boss, I have a meeting in my...

529
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,708
He'll stay there as well.

530
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:09,666
Sleep in the car,
and drive her back in the morning.

531
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:11,125
Okay.

532
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:13,083
Love you.

533
00:49:13,916 --> 00:49:15,791
- Meow!
- Meow.

534
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:19,750
Come on, Danny, quick!
It'll take two hours to reach Vashi.

535
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:28,666
It will benefit you
if I stay on the job, Boss.

536
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:42,916
Where in Vashi do you want to go?

537
00:49:44,208 --> 00:49:45,291
I don't know.

538
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:46,708
What do you mean?

539
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:48,750
I mean, I don't know!

540
00:49:51,916 --> 00:49:55,083
Stop screwing around, Lovely.
Tell me where you want to go.

541
00:49:56,166 --> 00:49:58,000
Let's run away?

542
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:01,500
Are you deaf, bastard!

543
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,250
Do your lovey-dovey antics at home!

544
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:06,458
Lovely, don't do it.

545
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:09,500
I'll get lovey-dovey with your dad!
Take me to your house!

546
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:12,791
Lovely!

547
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:16,625
- Lovely, what...
- Scared little bitch!

548
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:19,208
Sit down.

549
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:24,416
Are you crazy?

550
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:26,500
I'm Khobre's daughter.

551
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:29,541
Lower it.

552
00:50:29,708 --> 00:50:32,291
Now listen, what you did right now...

553
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:34,416
Lovely...

554
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,333
Stop. Stop it.

555
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:38,000
I said stop it!

556
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,041
Lovely, show it to me.

557
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:00,666
I feel suffocated at home...

558
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:03,708
Since my childhood.

559
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:07,666
I just wanted an ordinary life.

560
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:13,583
To be able to walk on the streets,
travel by bus, the local train...

561
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:16,541
Alone.

562
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:22,541
You know, till date,
none of my friends have fought with me

563
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:27,583
or teased me or scolded me or defeated me.

564
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,916
Just...

565
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:33,250
But everyone treated me like a queen...

566
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:36,708
I could see the fear in their eyes...

567
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,333
Always.

568
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:44,375
All my life,
I've been stuck with the name Khobre

569
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:47,375
like a curse...

570
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,125
What did I want from life, Danny?

571
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:56,083
Love, right?

572
00:51:58,625 --> 00:51:59,583
And what did I get?

573
00:52:02,875 --> 00:52:04,416
The builder's son!

574
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:09,833
<i>I want to live with you</i>

575
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:17,250
<i>Won't you die with me?</i>

576
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:25,000
<i>I want to live with you</i>

577
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:32,000
<i>Won't you die with me?</i>

578
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:38,250
<i>As the rains pour</i>

579
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:43,625
<i>And the clouds roar,
Stay with me</i>

580
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:49,666
<i>On those dark nights,
Make me laugh so hard</i>

581
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,125
<i>That my tears trickle down my cheeks</i>

582
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:55,958
<i>I want to live with you</i>

583
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:03,541
<i>Won't you die with me?</i>

584
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:28,125
<i>Let's cross the tunnel</i>

585
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:33,541
<i>Into our next life</i>

586
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:41,916
<i>A moment where</i>

587
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:49,375
<i>We melt away in each other's arms</i>

588
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:55,583
<i>Let's fulfill our desire to live</i>

589
00:53:57,166 --> 00:54:03,958
<i>This way, if we have to...</i>

590
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:05,708
Why don't we run away!

591
00:54:06,083 --> 00:54:09,000
Once we get married,
everyone will accept it.

592
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:11,500
Accept it!

593
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:17,291
To make the servant their groom,
instead of the builder's son!

594
00:54:19,666 --> 00:54:21,250
Do you know what he'd do to me?

595
00:54:24,625 --> 00:54:29,666
We can start a new life with new names...
Somewhere far away from here!

596
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:33,250
They will find us one way or another.

597
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:38,458
There's no way to escape
them in this country.

598
00:54:38,916 --> 00:54:40,125
And outside the country?

599
00:54:40,875 --> 00:54:44,250
Where will we go?
London, America?

600
00:54:44,458 --> 00:54:45,416
Canada.

601
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:49,000
Aalaap called you?

602
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:52,625
No... Rasika did.

603
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,333
She said Aalaap offered it to you as well...

604
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,416
What?

605
00:54:58,791 --> 00:55:01,708
They have a lot of contacts
in the government there, Danny...

606
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:04,666
They can easily get
our permanent residency visa.

607
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:08,291
Then he must have also told you
how much money they'll take!

608
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,750
One crore rupees!
Where would we get such a sum?

609
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:12,000
We'll get it!

610
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:13,916
- Where will we get it?
- We'll get it!

611
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:17,041
And until we get it, we can hide here.

612
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:21,625
Kerala, Tamil Nadu,
Manipur, Assam, anywhere!

613
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:24,791
Look...

614
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:30,333
Without you,

615
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:33,625
my life is like death.

616
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,333
But the truth is,

617
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:44,958
we won't die without each other.

618
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:50,375
We'll have to learn to live
without each other.

619
00:55:53,791 --> 00:55:54,750
You learn!

620
00:55:56,416 --> 00:55:59,333
I'm going to blow my brains out
on the wedding night.

621
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:26,791
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star...</i>

622
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:30,041
Forgot about the Kurla encounter?

623
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:32,833
If Mr. Gopal wasn't there,

624
00:56:32,916 --> 00:56:36,375
you would have been hanged
for that kid's murder, motherfucker.

625
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:39,333
Sorry, Mr. Gopal, I am with you.

626
00:56:40,708 --> 00:56:42,583
There is at least
four crores in that van...

627
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:48,041
Do I need to tell you separately?

628
00:56:48,166 --> 00:56:51,041
Should I give it in writing now?

629
00:57:12,625 --> 00:57:14,083
<i>I look 'em dead in the eyes</i>

630
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:16,583
<i>When I tell them there's certain things
For which I'm ready to die</i>

631
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:19,291
<i>The money, the pride, the glory,
The life, we test fate</i>

632
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:23,125
<i>Bring guns to the fight
But then carry knives just in case</i>

633
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:25,708
<i>Who you place your trust in?
Who you know gon' stay solid</i>

634
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:27,750
<i>When enemies bust in, huh?</i>

635
00:57:27,916 --> 00:57:30,250
<i>Keep the circle tight,
Nothing's what it seems</i>

636
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:32,791
<i>Nightmares every night
When you chase the dream</i>

637
00:57:33,666 --> 00:57:35,750
<i>What are you chasing now?</i>

638
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:37,458
They're stopping.

639
00:57:56,583 --> 00:57:58,041
Danny, there's nothing here...

640
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:08,500
Get down.

641
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:10,750
What happened?

642
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:28,458
Down... down...

643
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:35,041
Danny.

644
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:39,375
What?
What is going on?

645
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:44,416
What are you doing, Danny?

646
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:46,333
God has answered your prayers.

647
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:49,750
Do you know how much money
is in that van?

648
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,833
So much... That forget Canada,
we can go to any country in the world!

649
00:58:58,125 --> 00:58:59,208
Lovely...

650
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:01,166
Listen...

651
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:10,208
Hide behind that rock...
I'll be back before you know it.

652
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:11,666
No...

653
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,458
There's no time, Lovely... Go!

654
00:59:17,083 --> 00:59:18,208
Get inside.

655
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:20,875
I won't let you go alone!

656
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:23,291
- It's too dangerous!
- That's why I'm saying it.

657
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:27,000
I want to live with you.

658
00:59:28,875 --> 00:59:30,541
Won't you die with me?

659
00:59:35,666 --> 00:59:36,666
Come on.

660
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:16,916
What are you doing, Danny?

661
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,541
He will be the one to get screwed
for the robbery.

662
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:22,208
Lovely, come here.

663
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:26,041
Give me a hand.

664
01:00:40,791 --> 01:00:41,916
Come on.

665
01:00:51,666 --> 01:00:52,708
What do we do?

666
01:00:53,458 --> 01:00:55,125
We have to take this van...

667
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:58,666
Let's put him in our car
and blow it up.

668
01:00:58,791 --> 01:01:00,333
Come on. Let's go.

669
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:06,208
Come on.

670
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,250
Grab his hand.

671
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:21,666
This way.

672
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:29,541
Come on.

673
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,458
Run!

674
01:02:24,916 --> 01:02:26,958
Fucking hell!

675
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:29,958
Yeah!

676
01:03:16,916 --> 01:03:18,125
Go check the back.

677
01:03:32,416 --> 01:03:33,666
Did you find the key?

678
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:36,000
I'm checking, one second...

679
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:17,625
PEANUTS

680
01:04:28,416 --> 01:04:29,791
Get off.

681
01:04:31,541 --> 01:04:32,791
Get lost.

682
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:34,625
Go away.

683
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,208
Paaji! You're still awake?

684
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:40,583
Yes, Mr. Madam.

685
01:04:40,666 --> 01:04:45,125
Listen...
Your friends are here with me...

686
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:46,666
Talk to them.

687
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:52,208
Hello, Paaji!
It's me, Jehangir.

688
01:04:54,125 --> 01:04:57,791
Paaji, we're in big trouble.
You're the only one who can save us.

689
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:02,666
<i>I beg of you... Please help us!</i>

690
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:06,625
Paaji, a-are you listening?

691
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:09,958
Paaji...

692
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:13,458
- Heard it?
- Yes, ma'am. I'll be there.

693
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:32,041
It's true, Ms. Pammi.

694
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:33,958
When I was posted in Gadchiroli,

695
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:37,541
we used their weapons to deal with Naxals.

696
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:41,833
And we've bought stuff from them
many times in Mumbai as well,

697
01:05:42,125 --> 01:05:43,166
for encounters.

698
01:05:44,916 --> 01:05:47,375
They are considered
the Picassos of their business.

699
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:51,916
From Kashmir to Kanyakumari,
their weapons are used by everyone.

700
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:53,833
But not in Maharashtra...

701
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:57,166
We had an understanding with them.

702
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:59,208
If they don't sell their guns here,

703
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:02,166
we won't arrest them.

704
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:05,333
That's why they haven't
been nabbed before...

705
01:06:05,666 --> 01:06:07,625
They still wouldn't
have been nabbed...

706
01:06:08,416 --> 01:06:12,375
<i>But their guns turned up
in UP at some minister's murder case.</i>

707
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:16,666
<i>Since the governments of both places
are from the same party,</i>

708
01:06:16,875 --> 01:06:18,875
<i>we had to do it our way.</i>

709
01:06:21,625 --> 01:06:23,125
Dad! Police!

710
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:28,125
Run!

711
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:46,583
I can't testify against them.

712
01:06:48,791 --> 01:06:50,083
I don't want you to.

713
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:52,250
Then?

714
01:06:55,291 --> 01:06:57,125
Madam, we are very ordinary people...

715
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:02,833
Have some mercy, please.

716
01:07:05,916 --> 01:07:09,000
{\an8}Whatever we have earned
in this business, you can take it all!

717
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,166
{\an8}You'll bribe me?

718
01:07:12,166 --> 01:07:13,833
{\an8}No, madam... Think of it as a gift.

719
01:07:14,291 --> 01:07:18,041
{\an8}Oh! How much will you give me as a gift?

720
01:07:18,916 --> 01:07:21,291
We have saved three lakhs,
madam... Take it all!

721
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:28,666
With three lakhs, we won't even be able
to buy peanuts for the whole station.

722
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:30,333
What about crores?

723
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:36,416
At least three crores of rupees
is transported by a car,

724
01:07:37,041 --> 01:07:38,000
every night.

725
01:07:38,541 --> 01:07:41,083
The driver is from our village.

726
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:43,625
He made the plan.

727
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:51,041
It's a risky job, Ms. Pammi.

728
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:54,291
That it is...

729
01:07:57,416 --> 01:08:00,375
Did you arrange your money?

730
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,541
So then, do it...

731
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,416
The arrangement!

732
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:16,833
There's fish... The river...

733
01:08:18,166 --> 01:08:21,708
Throw in the bait and reel it in,
fucking hell!

734
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:26,916
One crore is yours,
the rest is ours...

735
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:32,541
Weapons?

736
01:08:36,666 --> 01:08:37,750
{\an8}You'll get them.

737
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:44,875
I'm giving you twenty four hours.

738
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:50,375
Two of you will go,
the third will stay here, as a guarantee.

739
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:52,916
Which two?

740
01:09:05,791 --> 01:09:08,500
{\an8}MUMBAI POLICE

741
01:09:15,083 --> 01:09:16,791
He's a very old friend of ours...

742
01:09:18,958 --> 01:09:20,666
We all came to Mumbai together.

743
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,666
Who is it at this hour...

744
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:33,875
Brother, you?

745
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:36,958
Is everything okay?

746
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:41,833
There's no danger...

747
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:44,208
Between Navi Mumbai and Panvel,

748
01:09:46,583 --> 01:09:50,291
the old Khandala road stretches five
to six kilometers... Completely deserted.

749
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:54,500
You have to come and kill
two guards, that's it!

750
01:09:55,833 --> 01:10:00,041
Three to four crores
in three to four minutes!

751
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
When do you want to do it?

752
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:17,375
Tonight.

753
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:18,833
Tonight won't be possible...

754
01:10:21,666 --> 01:10:23,625
I took leave yesterday
for the whole week...

755
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:26,916
So call them and cancel it.

756
01:10:27,375 --> 01:10:32,416
But then those fucking cops
will come catch me first...

757
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,250
S-Sorry, madam...

758
01:10:38,041 --> 01:10:39,333
You too, sir.

759
01:10:40,541 --> 01:10:45,083
It has to happen tonight, Mamu...
Think of another way.

760
01:10:48,541 --> 01:10:49,791
There is one...

761
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:56,041
If... I get called in for some reason.

762
01:10:56,375 --> 01:10:57,750
How will that happen?

763
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:04,791
If the driver on duty doesn't show up,

764
01:11:04,916 --> 01:11:06,833
then they will have to call me...

765
01:11:06,958 --> 01:11:08,375
But why won't he show up?

766
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:24,875
In that lane... Two left,
then one right then two more left...

767
01:11:25,041 --> 01:11:28,416
In the yellow-colored building,
ask anyone for Ganesh.

768
01:11:33,291 --> 01:11:34,708
Send his photo on WhatsApp.

769
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:35,916
Yes. Photo.

770
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:37,958
I'll forward it to you.

771
01:11:38,541 --> 01:11:39,791
No, everyone.

772
01:11:40,333 --> 01:11:41,625
Should I make a group?

773
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:43,291
It will be easy...

774
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:49,000
What should I name it?

775
01:11:50,416 --> 01:11:51,833
Name it Peanuts!

776
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:54,625
Yes... Peanuts.

777
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:59,958
Do you spell that
as "peenuts" or "peanuts"?

778
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,958
Peanuts.

779
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:04,458
I thought so too.

780
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:05,875
Did you?

781
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:07,125
Now, come on.

782
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,833
He's gone to meet his relatives...
In Kalva...

783
01:12:21,458 --> 01:12:23,125
Why isn't he answering his phone?

784
01:12:23,541 --> 01:12:25,583
His phone fell
in the toilet last night.

785
01:12:28,666 --> 01:12:29,875
- This one.
- That's okay!

786
01:12:30,416 --> 01:12:31,625
It's ruined.

787
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:35,666
He'll go get it fixed today...

788
01:12:37,416 --> 01:12:38,875
But what happened, madam?

789
01:12:39,416 --> 01:12:42,791
Why are you looking for Ganesh?

790
01:12:43,416 --> 01:12:44,750
Just an inquiry...

791
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:55,083
Hello.

792
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:58,333
Ma'am, he's in the next lane.
Come quick.

793
01:12:58,541 --> 01:12:59,625
Okay.

794
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:01,083
Fine.

795
01:13:02,208 --> 01:13:03,458
Inform Ganesh.

796
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:04,875
Yes.

797
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:13,000
Take one each.

798
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:17,791
Deliver it to the right place...

799
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:20,166
And count the money properly
and get it back...

800
01:13:20,541 --> 01:13:24,708
If there's even a rupee missing
I'll cut it out of your ass!

801
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:26,916
- Make timely delivery...
- Ganesh?

802
01:13:30,708 --> 01:13:31,625
Run!

803
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:33,458
What the...

804
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:34,750
Stop.

805
01:13:42,791 --> 01:13:46,666
<i>Doomed, I am doomed</i>

806
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:51,291
<i>Doomed, I am doomed</i>

807
01:13:54,708 --> 01:13:58,750
<i>Doomed, I am doomed</i>

808
01:13:59,791 --> 01:14:02,000
We haven't done anything.

809
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:04,666
We haven't done anything.

810
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:09,833
<i>The boy's crazy,
And the girl's lovely</i>

811
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,291
<i>Walking down the aisle,
But there's trouble brewing</i>

812
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:20,625
<i>I was happy alone, I wonder
What made me wish for a wife</i>

813
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:24,625
<i>Doomed, I am doomed</i>

814
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:29,791
<i>Doomed, I am doomed</i>

815
01:14:36,166 --> 01:14:38,291
Stop! Stop!

816
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:40,000
Ganesh, stop!

817
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:41,833
Ganesh, stop!

818
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:45,041
You will regret it
when I catch up with you.

819
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:47,750
Move. Move.

820
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:52,583
Madam, I'll need only a minute.

821
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:54,166
How many times do I have to tell you?

822
01:14:54,291 --> 01:14:55,333
Let me...

823
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,791
I just opened the shop.
Please go someplace else.

824
01:14:57,875 --> 01:14:59,958
- Just these two hairs...
- I just opened the shop.

825
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:02,416
- This one.
- Please go someplace else.

826
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:06,625
<i>I was happy alone,
I wonder what made me wish for a wife</i>

827
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:10,666
<i>Doomed, I am doomed</i>

828
01:15:10,791 --> 01:15:12,875
<i>Doomed, I am doomed</i>

829
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,791
Ganesh!

830
01:15:17,708 --> 01:15:19,000
We just want to talk... Come down...

831
01:15:19,125 --> 01:15:19,958
Trust me...

832
01:15:20,041 --> 01:15:22,625
- No, sir.
- Come down.

833
01:15:22,791 --> 01:15:24,125
Come down. Trust me.

834
01:15:24,583 --> 01:15:25,708
Asshole.

835
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:28,208
Honestly... just come down.

836
01:15:28,333 --> 01:15:30,333
- This is in your interest.
- No, madam.

837
01:15:30,458 --> 01:15:31,833
Come down.

838
01:15:32,791 --> 01:15:34,041
Ganesh...

839
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:35,750
Mamu.

840
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:53,291
Ganesh!

841
01:15:54,541 --> 01:15:56,208
You idiot!

842
01:15:56,875 --> 01:15:58,916
Make that WhatsApp group now, you fucker.

843
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:18,708
More sauce.

844
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:26,041
Hold this.

845
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:37,833
Hello.

846
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:40,125
Yes.

847
01:16:41,625 --> 01:16:44,125
Yes. No, I'll be there on time.

848
01:16:44,708 --> 01:16:45,583
Yes.

849
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:52,833
They called me to work.

850
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:06,000
Ms. Pammi.

851
01:17:07,166 --> 01:17:09,041
Can I ask you a question
if you don't mind?

852
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:10,041
Ask away, Paaji.

853
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:12,958
Why are you doing this?

854
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:20,708
For one good stretch, Paaji.

855
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:22,541
Good stretch?

856
01:17:27,083 --> 01:17:29,291
Have you seen the size
of our staff quarters?

857
01:17:30,541 --> 01:17:32,458
The size of a matchbox.

858
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:35,333
And look at me.

859
01:17:36,791 --> 01:17:41,666
When I stretch, my head hits the ceiling.

860
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:48,958
So, I've seen a nice plot in Lonavala.

861
01:17:49,125 --> 01:17:50,541
Great. Where?

862
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,875
The guy that writes songs for films.

863
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:58,500
Right behind his bungalow.

864
01:18:00,041 --> 01:18:01,041
Which lyricist?

865
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:07,583
The guy that wrote, "The way
I felt when I saw a girl..."

866
01:18:07,666 --> 01:18:08,500
Javed Akhtar...

867
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:10,500
Javed Akhtar...

868
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:16,875
{\an8}- Yes, Mamu?
- Some fuckers ambushed us!

869
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:20,000
They are heading towards you.
Stop them.

870
01:18:20,166 --> 01:18:21,583
{\an8}Fuck!

871
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:22,875
Paaji!

872
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:39,291
Shoot them, Paaji.

873
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:05,083
{\an8}Get the glass cutter.

874
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:31,750
Danny! Danny, wake up!

875
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:36,958
Fuck!

876
01:19:41,916 --> 01:19:42,958
Paaji!

877
01:19:43,125 --> 01:19:44,125
I'm checking!

878
01:19:48,041 --> 01:19:48,916
Lovely?

879
01:19:50,291 --> 01:19:51,166
Who is Lovely?

880
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:52,625
Lovely Khobre.

881
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:57,375
Narayan Khobre's daughter, Lovely Khobre?

882
01:19:58,666 --> 01:20:00,333
What the fuck is she doing here?

883
01:20:00,416 --> 01:20:01,583
Shall I shoot her?

884
01:20:02,458 --> 01:20:04,166
Have you lost your mind, Paaji?

885
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:07,625
Khobre will burn down the whole of Mumbai.
Give it to me.

886
01:20:15,708 --> 01:20:16,916
Lovely!

887
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:22,666
Who is it?

888
01:20:22,791 --> 01:20:25,458
It's me, Paaji... Your father's friend.

889
01:20:27,041 --> 01:20:28,500
What are you doing here?

890
01:20:29,375 --> 01:20:30,750
What are you doing here?

891
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:35,291
Come out, I will explain everything.

892
01:20:35,666 --> 01:20:39,791
What do you take me for?
If I come out, you'll shoot me.

893
01:20:43,958 --> 01:20:46,125
Darling, I can shoot you inside as well.

894
01:20:51,666 --> 01:20:53,791
Come out... Nothing will happen.

895
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,416
Lovely.

896
01:21:41,958 --> 01:21:43,541
How did you end up here?

897
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:44,666
Shut up.

898
01:21:47,458 --> 01:21:48,791
Lower the weapon.

899
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:50,416
You guys first.

900
01:22:07,708 --> 01:22:10,041
When your father
used to work in Byculla,

901
01:22:11,916 --> 01:22:13,875
I used to feed you in my arms.

902
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,375
Had I not been there, he would've lost
his head along with his legs.

903
01:22:20,291 --> 01:22:21,625
{\an8}Now put it down...

904
01:22:23,833 --> 01:22:24,833
Down!

905
01:22:32,916 --> 01:22:34,166
- Take it down.
- Left or right?

906
01:22:34,291 --> 01:22:35,333
Take it down!

907
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:36,458
I am.

908
01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:40,416
Paaji?

909
01:22:51,916 --> 01:22:53,041
Paaji, stop!

910
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,916
Paaji, stop shooting.
It's me, Gopal.

911
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:22,833
Paaji, what the fuck are you doing here?

912
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,416
You tell us, motherfucker!
How did you come here?

913
01:23:26,791 --> 01:23:27,916
<i>Jai Hind,</i> Mr. Madam.

914
01:23:30,416 --> 01:23:31,416
You too?

915
01:23:36,166 --> 01:23:37,083
Lovely?

916
01:23:38,916 --> 01:23:40,166
What are you doing here?

917
01:23:51,375 --> 01:23:52,833
Danny, you...

918
01:23:54,583 --> 01:23:56,250
You two are...

919
01:23:57,291 --> 01:23:58,791
Holy shit...

920
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:02,958
And who are these two?

921
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:05,625
They are with us.

922
01:24:07,583 --> 01:24:08,541
Us?

923
01:24:09,833 --> 01:24:11,833
You are all together?

924
01:24:17,083 --> 01:24:18,041
Mr. Madam...

925
01:24:20,208 --> 01:24:21,875
There's three crores in the van...

926
01:24:24,041 --> 01:24:25,500
Let's split it equally.

927
01:24:29,291 --> 01:24:30,583
We'll have to discuss it.

928
01:24:32,833 --> 01:24:33,708
Us too...

929
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,375
{\an8}Fine...
I'll count to five.

930
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:41,875
At five, we all will throw
our weapons there...

931
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:43,458
Okay?

932
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:47,333
One...

933
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:52,958
Two...

934
01:24:55,791 --> 01:24:56,708
Three...

935
01:24:58,666 --> 01:24:59,666
Four...

936
01:25:02,166 --> 01:25:03,458
Five!

937
01:25:05,541 --> 01:25:11,041
Fuck... There's no decency left
in this world. You are all dogs!

938
01:25:15,166 --> 01:25:16,458
I'll count one more time...

939
01:25:19,041 --> 01:25:20,833
Be sincere and drop them.

940
01:25:23,666 --> 01:25:24,625
One...

941
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,375
Two...

942
01:25:28,083 --> 01:25:28,916
Three...

943
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:30,916
Four...

944
01:25:32,375 --> 01:25:33,458
Five!

945
01:25:51,583 --> 01:25:52,666
Fucking idiots...

946
01:25:57,750 --> 01:25:59,375
Who should I kill first?

947
01:26:05,291 --> 01:26:09,083
There is only one God!

948
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:15,041
Now your soul will leave
from your ass towards the Grim Reaper...

949
01:26:21,333 --> 01:26:22,916
<i>Jai Hind,</i> Mr. Madam...

950
01:26:30,791 --> 01:26:32,750
Fucking hell! Look.

951
01:26:38,416 --> 01:26:39,541
Paaji?

952
01:26:42,208 --> 01:26:45,541
You can't even take a joke?
Unbelievable...

953
01:26:46,666 --> 01:26:48,375
I mean it...
Look...

954
01:26:48,583 --> 01:26:52,000
There goes my gun. Look.

955
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:55,041
Really... I was joking...

956
01:26:58,750 --> 01:26:59,708
Paaji.

957
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:24,458
Hide in there.

958
01:27:25,375 --> 01:27:26,458
Take your guns.

959
01:27:30,666 --> 01:27:32,666
Here, take it!

960
01:27:33,125 --> 01:27:35,500
- Here!
- Come on!

961
01:27:35,791 --> 01:27:39,083
Assholes. Where the fuck is my gun?

962
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,125
Laxmi!

963
01:28:24,208 --> 01:28:25,458
You know them?

964
01:28:27,583 --> 01:28:29,041
I can make a deal with them.

965
01:28:29,166 --> 01:28:32,416
Are you crazy? We're police...
They'll kill us right here, fucker!

966
01:28:34,541 --> 01:28:36,041
He's right...

967
01:28:38,166 --> 01:28:39,958
I won't tell them you're a cop.

968
01:28:40,083 --> 01:28:41,000
And me?

969
01:28:43,541 --> 01:28:44,958
I'll make them forgive it.

970
01:28:47,833 --> 01:28:48,875
And if they don't?

971
01:28:50,083 --> 01:28:51,083
Then strip!

972
01:29:23,708 --> 01:29:25,875
Come out if you're still alive.

973
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:42,666
Ms. Laxmi!

974
01:29:46,458 --> 01:29:47,291
Shankar.

975
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:06,208
Sardar?

976
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:19,000
What are you doing here?

977
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:23,666
What happened here?

978
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:32,000
He's selling us out.

979
01:30:33,458 --> 01:30:35,125
He'll die but he won't betray us.

980
01:30:44,333 --> 01:30:46,000
Ask the rest of them to come out.

981
01:30:49,416 --> 01:30:50,666
Come out, everyone.

982
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:52,500
Leave your weapons.

983
01:31:32,833 --> 01:31:33,875
Now leave.

984
01:31:48,666 --> 01:31:50,833
I'm letting you go because of Paaji...

985
01:31:51,458 --> 01:31:53,458
Otherwise, I would
have buried you alive.

986
01:32:04,666 --> 01:32:05,708
Paaji.

987
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:11,041
Ms. Pammi.

988
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:16,583
I am with them from today.

989
01:32:24,916 --> 01:32:30,166
<i>The earthy scent of blood...</i>

990
01:32:31,291 --> 01:32:36,708
<i>The air is filled
With the aroma of blood</i>

991
01:32:50,541 --> 01:32:55,791
<i>The earthy scent of blood...</i>

992
01:32:57,041 --> 01:33:02,583
<i>The air is filled
With the aroma of blood</i>

993
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:08,666
<i>It flows out of the heart</i>

994
01:33:09,708 --> 01:33:15,208
<i>And into the earth...</i>

995
01:33:16,291 --> 01:33:21,958
<i>The heart is hollow
Completely hollow</i>

996
01:33:22,666 --> 01:33:27,625
<i>Not a soul in sight</i>

997
01:33:29,041 --> 01:33:35,458
<i>Tears of blood trickling down the cheeks...</i>

998
01:33:35,583 --> 01:33:40,750
<i>The earthy scent of blood...</i>

999
01:33:41,708 --> 01:33:48,000
<i>The air is filled
With the aroma of blood</i>

1000
01:34:07,291 --> 01:34:09,750
<i>The lava of greed...</i>

1001
01:34:10,458 --> 01:34:13,333
<i>Is a call of death</i>

1002
01:34:13,583 --> 01:34:16,833
<i>The ego is barking out aloud...</i>

1003
01:34:17,041 --> 01:34:19,833
<i>Listen! Listen! Listen!</i>

1004
01:34:19,916 --> 01:34:23,291
<i>It's loud and clear</i>

1005
01:34:23,458 --> 01:34:27,458
<i>Loud and clear</i>

1006
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:33,166
<i>Dishonesty is your character</i>

1007
01:34:34,458 --> 01:34:39,708
<i>Your only business is crime</i>

1008
01:34:40,916 --> 01:34:47,125
<i>Your soul is selling for a dime</i>

1009
01:34:47,458 --> 01:34:53,583
<i>The earthy scent of blood...</i>

1010
01:34:53,708 --> 01:35:00,083
<i>The air is filled
With the aroma of blood</i>

1011
01:35:06,875 --> 01:35:12,708
<i>This aroma will spread far and wide</i>

1012
01:35:18,541 --> 01:35:24,666
<i>Each soul will tremble</i>

1013
01:35:28,291 --> 01:35:33,541
<i>Each body will reek</i>

1014
01:35:49,791 --> 01:35:56,750
<i>The earthy scent of blood...</i>

1015
01:36:41,291 --> 01:36:43,583
Mr. Madam, what are you doing?

1016
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:45,250
D-Don't...

1017
01:36:47,041 --> 01:36:49,833
Mr. Madam, we'll come up with a story.

1018
01:36:50,291 --> 01:36:52,041
Together, we killed these Naxals.

1019
01:36:52,625 --> 01:36:54,208
We'll split the money halfway.

1020
01:36:55,208 --> 01:36:56,875
And we'll get a medal of honor.

1021
01:36:57,666 --> 01:37:00,583
What will you get from killing me?
You'll be dead too.

1022
01:37:01,166 --> 01:37:02,583
What is your logic?

1023
01:37:04,083 --> 01:37:07,958
Fuck the logic...

1024
01:37:08,875 --> 01:37:10,250
Mr. Madam, no.

1025
01:37:12,166 --> 01:37:15,333
This is my character!

1026
01:37:34,083 --> 01:37:36,041
<i>Sonata Bar and Restaurant...</i>

1027
01:37:38,541 --> 01:37:42,875
Deshpande was throwing a party
for his son passing his exams...

1028
01:37:45,291 --> 01:37:49,583
We had food and were going to Lonavala...

1029
01:37:49,708 --> 01:37:52,041
For a long drive...

1030
01:37:55,041 --> 01:37:58,208
And on the way,
the encounter happened...

1031
01:37:58,791 --> 01:37:59,916
{\an8}Khobre's gang...

1032
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,500
{\an8}The van driver was working with them...

1033
01:38:03,291 --> 01:38:05,541
{\an8}They had already killed
the security officers

1034
01:38:05,708 --> 01:38:07,083
{\an8}and the loaders before we reached...

1035
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,958
We challenged them...

1036
01:38:09,083 --> 01:38:11,666
And within a few minutes
we had them under control...

1037
01:38:12,458 --> 01:38:14,833
But I don't know
how the Naxals ended up there.

1038
01:38:16,083 --> 01:38:18,166
We tried to tackle them,

1039
01:38:19,625 --> 01:38:21,875
but couldn't keep up
with their weapons...

1040
01:38:22,666 --> 01:38:23,750
Everyone was killed...

1041
01:38:24,958 --> 01:38:27,583
Only Paaji, Ms. Poonam and I were alive.

1042
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:31,708
<i>With the van and the money,
they were taking us to their hideout...</i>

1043
01:38:32,791 --> 01:38:34,250
<i>I saw an opportunity,</i>

1044
01:38:34,416 --> 01:38:37,333
<i>and without thinking too much,
I attacked the driver...</i>

1045
01:38:39,083 --> 01:38:43,250
{\an8}The van went out of control
and started rolling down the hill...

1046
01:38:44,708 --> 01:38:48,791
{\an8}It went and crashed
into the abandoned fort's wall... Boom!

1047
01:38:49,875 --> 01:38:52,291
<i>Half of the Naxals were killed
in the accident...</i>

1048
01:38:53,291 --> 01:38:56,916
<i>But we didn't know that their leader,
Laxmi, was still alive...</i>

1049
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:01,166
<i>She used her last bullet
to shoot Paaji right in the head.</i>

1050
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,458
<i>Then she used a grenade to attack us.</i>

1051
01:39:05,333 --> 01:39:08,458
<i>At the last moment, Mr. Madam
pushed me out of the blast radius...</i>

1052
01:39:09,291 --> 01:39:12,208
Guards, arms!

1053
01:39:12,416 --> 01:39:14,833
<i>I'm alive only thanks to Mr. Madam.</i>

1054
01:39:15,333 --> 01:39:16,291
Fire.

1055
01:39:16,875 --> 01:39:19,541
<i>She deserves this medal.</i>

1056
01:39:21,166 --> 01:39:22,000
Fire.

1057
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:27,708
<i>All of this is because of Ms. Pammi...
Sorry, Mr. Madam's sacrifice.</i>

1058
01:39:29,541 --> 01:39:35,166
Every breath I take will forever
be in her debt...

1059
01:39:37,875 --> 01:39:39,625
We are all proud of you...

1060
01:39:40,375 --> 01:39:41,375
Thank you, sir.

1061

<i>Greetings.</i>

of Diwali with joy and new hope.</i>

1077
01:41:18,458 --> 01:41:21,416
<i>Today I'll be speaking to you</i>

1078
01:41:22,250 --> 01:41:25,125
<i>about some critical issues...</i>

1079

<i>To break the grip of corruption
and black money,</i>

1080
01:41:36,791 --> 01:41:39,958
<i>an important step needs to be taken.</i>

1081
01:41:41,083 --> 01:41:48,083
<i>From midnight tonight,
that is 8th November, 2016, at 12am,</i>

1082
01:41:49,958 --> 01:41:55,958
<i>the five hundred and thousand rupee
currency notes presently in use</i>

1083
01:41:57,041 --> 01:42:00,541
<i>will no longer be legal tender.</i>

1084
01:42:13,541 --> 01:42:15,625
- <i>Five hundred...</i>
- Bijju.

1085
01:42:15,708 --> 01:42:18,250
<i>and thousand rupee currency notes...</i>

1086
01:42:18,333 --> 01:42:20,208
What benefit did you get
out of this, sir?

1087
01:42:20,333 --> 01:42:23,458
{\an8}- Papa, what happened?
- <i>...transactions will not be acceptable.</i>

1088
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:28,791
<i>Five hundred and thousand rupee notes,</i>

1089

<i>hoarded by anti-national

1091
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:45,458
<i>...will become just

<i>These good-for-nothing stray dogs</i>

<i>Humankind would regret this disdain</i>

1104
01:44:56,708 --> 01:45:02,000
<i>Should they desire to rule the world,
They could</i>

1105
01:45:06,791 --> 01:45:12,083
<i>And chew upon the very bones
Of their masters</i>

1106
01:45:16,791 --> 01:45:21,750
<i>If only they were cautioned
Of their poverty</i>

1107
01:45:21,875 --> 01:45:27,250

On their inanimate tails...</i>
