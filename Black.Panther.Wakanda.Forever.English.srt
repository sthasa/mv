1
00:00:04,765 --> 00:00:05,845
Bast...

2
00:00:06,725 --> 00:00:08,645
Time is running out.

3
00:00:09,815 --> 00:00:12,315
Please allow me to heal my brother of this illness,

4
00:00:12,985 --> 00:00:15,525
and I will never question your existence again.

5
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:18,365
His heart rate is dropping fast. Where are we?

6
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:19,735
We are finishing a sequence now.

7
00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:21,365
Griot, give me the controls.

8
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:22,825
As you wish, Princess.

9
00:00:28,745 --> 00:00:29,995
What is the confidence rate?

10
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:31,745
25%.

11
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:33,875
We'll have to try another way.

12
00:00:34,505 --> 00:00:35,775
King T'Challa's heart rate

13
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:38,005
has fallen to 31 beats per minute.

14
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:40,715
Princess, you should go be by his side.

15
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:43,215
I have to think.
Everyone, get out.

16
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:45,635
Get out!

17
00:00:51,855 --> 00:00:53,025
What is the confidence rate?

18
00:00:53,105 --> 00:00:54,525
29.1%.

19
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:55,645
Print it!

20
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:02,485
Princess, I am aware of the urgency,

21
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:04,195
but I must warn you,

22
00:01:04,285 --> 00:01:06,155
this synthetic heart-shaped herb

23
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:08,705
has a minimal chance of producing the desired effects.

24
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:11,785
I don't care! Has to work.

25
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:32,105
Griot.

26
00:01:32,185 --> 00:01:33,225
Yes, Princess?

27
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:35,645
What's my brother's heart rate?

28
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:42,025
Your brother

29
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:45,615
is with the ancestors.

30
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:53,955
No.

31
00:02:29,245 --> 00:02:30,325
Praise the ancestors.

32
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:55,395
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

33
00:02:55,475 --> 00:03:00,355
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

34
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:04,695
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

35
00:03:05,865 --> 00:03:09,575
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

36
00:03:10,995 --> 00:03:13,865
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

37
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:20,085
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

38
00:03:21,585 --> 00:03:22,715
T'Challa

39
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:52,005
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

40
00:06:35,365 --> 00:06:37,075
It is an honor for me...

41
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:39,825
To invite Her Majesty, Queen Ramonda,

42
00:06:39,905 --> 00:06:41,325
daughter of Lumumba,

43
00:06:41,415 --> 00:06:43,375
sovereign ruler of the Kingdom of Wakanda.

44
00:06:56,925 --> 00:06:58,555
Mr. Chairperson,

45
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:04,145
I believe I speak for all the member states here

46
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:07,015
when I say that I am deeply disappointed

47
00:07:07,105 --> 00:07:09,185
in Wakanda's failure

48
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:13,735
to stand by promises to participate in global efforts

49
00:07:13,815 --> 00:07:15,905
to tackle international challenges,

50
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:17,485
to share resources,

51
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:19,785
and full cooperation

52
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:21,325
concerning vibranium.

53
00:07:39,095 --> 00:07:40,635
I now give the floor

54
00:07:40,715 --> 00:07:42,635
to Her Majesty, Queen Ramonda.

55
00:07:49,815 --> 00:07:52,605
It has always been our policy

56
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:57,695
to never trade vibranium under any circumstance.

57
00:07:57,775 --> 00:08:02,075
Not because of the dangerous potential of vibranium,

58
00:08:02,955 --> 00:08:07,745
but because of the dangerous potential of you.

59
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:52,045
You perform civility here.

60
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:55,125
But we know what you whisper

61
00:08:55,755 --> 00:08:57,505
in your halls of leadership

62
00:08:57,585 --> 00:09:00,465
and in your military facilities.

63
00:09:04,675 --> 00:09:07,595
"The King is dead.

64
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:12,355
"The Black Panther is gone.

65
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:17,525
"They have lost their protector.

66
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:26,655
"Now is our time...

67
00:09:28,165 --> 00:09:29,285
"To strike."

68
00:09:56,485 --> 00:09:58,355
Aneka, where is your spear?

69
00:09:58,445 --> 00:09:59,945
Shuri gave me these to try.

70
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:04,575
You know, I like them better.

71
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:06,335
Our foremothers gave us the spear...

72
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,075
Because it is precise, elegant...

73
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:11,785
And deadly.

74
00:10:14,745 --> 00:10:17,085
It will not change under my watch.

75
00:10:19,005 --> 00:10:20,465
Yes, general.

76
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,885
I told you not to bring them.

77
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:27,885
Last night there was another attack

78
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:30,475
on one of our outreach facilities.

79
00:10:31,395 --> 00:10:35,225
Proof of the involvement of a member state

80
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:39,315
is being uploaded to your mobile devices as we speak.

81
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:43,315
And as for the identity of the attackers...

82
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:06,555
Let our gracious response to this incursion

83
00:11:07,555 --> 00:11:09,055
be an olive branch.

84
00:11:11,055 --> 00:11:14,015
Further attempts on our resources

85
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:17,395
will be considered an act of aggression

86
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:21,105
and met with a much steeper response.

87
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:25,275
We mourn the loss of our King.

88
00:11:26,275 --> 00:11:28,695
But do not think for a second

89
00:11:28,785 --> 00:11:31,075
that Wakanda has lost her ability

90
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:33,705
to protect our resources.

91
00:11:34,365 --> 00:11:37,995
We are aware of the ongoing efforts by some

92
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:41,255
to find vibranium outside of Wakanda,

93
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:45,585
and wish you the best of luck.

94
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:52,475
This is rotor 625

95
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:53,845
requesting clearance to land.

96
00:11:57,935 --> 00:11:59,205
All right.
Meet you down there.

97
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:00,225
Yeah.

98
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:05,945
I thought you retired!

99
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,155
I thought I had too.

100
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:09,445
They said that machine had a one in a billion chance

101
00:12:09,535 --> 00:12:10,695
of finding vibranium.

102
00:12:10,785 --> 00:12:11,865
Oh, less than that.

103
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:34,845
Here we go.

104
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:36,995
Cabin pressure is stable

105
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:38,855
at negative one p-s-i.

106
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:45,815
At 800 feet,

107
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:47,945
passing through thermocline.

108
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:49,655
All my life supports in the green.

109
00:12:51,785 --> 00:12:52,865
Copy you.

110
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:03,585
We've touched down.

111
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:13,055
Perfect. So, Salazar,

112
00:13:13,135 --> 00:13:14,765
you are near the site right there.

113
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:18,145
Yeah, it's astonishing.

114
00:13:20,145 --> 00:13:21,475
The drill seemed to make contact

115
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:22,935
with a metallic substance.

116
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:26,235
Whatever it is, it's solid.

117
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:28,605
I've never seen a drill bit chewed up like this before.

118
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:33,235
I'll be.

119
00:13:33,905 --> 00:13:35,445
Vibranium in the ocean.

120
00:13:35,535 --> 00:13:37,495
Let's go ahead and get the detector out of there,

121
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:39,325
since it's the only one we've got.

122
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:42,785
Heading towards the vibranium detector.

123
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:55,885
Okay, Salazar, we just went dark.

124
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:58,185
Yeah.
The rig lost power.

125
00:13:58,265 --> 00:13:59,975
Copy that.
I'm gonna fix it up here.

126
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:17,645
What the hell was that?

127
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:32,215
Jackson,

128
00:14:32,295 --> 00:14:34,135
tell me you're seeing this?

129
00:14:34,215 --> 00:14:36,385
Hang on.
Salazar's heart rate.

130
00:14:36,465 --> 00:14:38,595
Hey, uh, Salazar, can you give me a visual?

131
00:14:40,515 --> 00:14:42,725
It's a phantom jellyfish.

132
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:44,435
I've never seen one this color.

133
00:14:45,105 --> 00:14:46,525
Emergency dive team, stand by.

134
00:14:46,605 --> 00:14:49,695
Salazar, uh, we just lost Jackson's vitals.

135
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:50,895
Can you see him?

136
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:00,535
No. He's gone.

137
00:15:00,615 --> 00:15:02,615
Can you clarify? What do you mean by, "he's gone"?

138
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,875
Salazar, do you copy?

139
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:08,755
Salazar?

140
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,175
Smitty, we got a situation out here.

141
00:15:26,145 --> 00:15:27,185
What's that sound?

142
00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:29,315
West, you got a visual on what's making that sound?

143
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:37,325
West, how copy, over?

144
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:42,075
West, you got a visual?

145
00:16:01,135 --> 00:16:02,655
It's some kind of sonic attack.

146
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:04,345
Hey, smitty, earplugs.

147
00:16:11,395 --> 00:16:12,685
We are under attack.

148
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:14,645
You need to send in a strike team immediately.

149
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:17,865
Copy. Mayday, mayday, this is rotor 625.

150
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:19,385
We are requesting assistance immediately.

151
00:16:19,405 --> 00:16:20,695
It's the Wakandans.

152
00:16:22,785 --> 00:16:23,905
It has to be.

153
00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:41,555
Henderson.

154
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:42,965
Smitty, we gotta go.

155
00:16:43,055 --> 00:16:44,055
Henderson!

156
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:46,595
Let's go.

157
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:49,815
What's going on?

158
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:51,605
Get off the edge.

159
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:31,305
Go, go, go, go!

160
00:17:38,485 --> 00:17:39,525
Now! Go!

161
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:41,655
Spin! Spin them off!

162
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:44,155
Okay. They're gone!

163
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:46,365
Oh, my god!

164
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:06,015
Just get us out.

165
00:18:06,095 --> 00:18:07,555
We're good.

166
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:08,975
We're good.

167
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,185
Where is the strike team?

168
00:18:10,435 --> 00:18:12,555
It wasn't the Wakandans.
They... they were blue.

169
00:18:12,645 --> 00:18:13,725
Everyone is dead...

170
00:18:15,975 --> 00:18:17,355
Shit. What is going on?

171
00:18:17,435 --> 00:18:19,275
We're getting pulled backwards.

172
00:18:20,405 --> 00:18:21,865
Oh, my god.

173
00:18:26,485 --> 00:18:28,785
Oh, god! Hang on!

174
00:19:03,655 --> 00:19:05,715
Queen Ramonda of the nation of Wakanda

175
00:19:05,735 --> 00:19:07,865
gave an electrifying speech at the UN yesterday,

176
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:09,405
while members of her military

177
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:11,155
escorted captive mercenaries

178
00:19:11,245 --> 00:19:12,705
onto the floor of the UN.

179
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,625
A year has passed since Queen Ramonda

180
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:16,745
was reinstated as ruler of Wakanda

181
00:19:16,835 --> 00:19:18,335
after King T'Challa's sudden death

182
00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:20,375
from an undisclosed illness last year.

183
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:22,715
All eyes are on the tiny, powerful nation,

184
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:25,385
as it finds itself increasingly isolated...

185
00:19:27,805 --> 00:19:29,635
Approaching the river border.

186
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:37,645
We are home.

187
00:20:27,735 --> 00:20:28,905
Princess.

188
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:30,035
Just a moment.

189
00:20:30,115 --> 00:20:31,445
I'm in the middle of something.

190
00:20:31,535 --> 00:20:33,155
I understand, Princess, however...

191
00:20:33,245 --> 00:20:34,955
You're disrupting my train of thought.

192
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,375
Shuri.

193
00:20:39,915 --> 00:20:40,915
Mother.

194
00:20:40,995 --> 00:20:42,145
I was trying to tell you.

195
00:20:42,165 --> 00:20:44,165
The queen is here.

196
00:20:44,255 --> 00:20:46,375
- Thank you.
- That thing unnerves me.

197
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:47,715
I think that one day

198
00:20:47,795 --> 00:20:50,095
artificial intelligence is going to kill us all.

199
00:20:50,175 --> 00:20:53,015
My ai isn't like the movies, mother.

200
00:20:53,095 --> 00:20:54,805
It does exactly what I tell it to do.

201
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:57,475
Yeah, if only children were the same.

202
00:20:58,685 --> 00:21:01,395
Everyone seems to be working diligently.

203
00:21:02,065 --> 00:21:05,605
Yes. Rapid emergency response task.

204
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:07,405
There could be any number of

205
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:09,155
unknown threats on the horizon,

206
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,905
and they're creating solutions.

207
00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:13,945
Oh, what is this?

208
00:21:14,035 --> 00:21:15,745
Exo suits for our army.

209
00:21:15,825 --> 00:21:18,325
It grants the user super-human strength,

210
00:21:18,415 --> 00:21:20,585
speed, and durability.

211
00:21:20,665 --> 00:21:23,085
But, as always, Okoye had notes.

212
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:24,415
What were her notes?

213
00:21:24,505 --> 00:21:25,875
She hates them.

214
00:21:31,295 --> 00:21:33,595
What about recreating the heart-shaped herb?

215
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:35,885
Have you made any progress on that?

216
00:21:35,975 --> 00:21:37,185
Excuse me, Princess.

217
00:21:37,265 --> 00:21:40,475
Nakia, daughter of yaa, is trying to reach you again.

218
00:21:40,555 --> 00:21:41,555
Maybe you should...

219
00:21:41,645 --> 00:21:43,395
Maybe you should continue your calculations

220
00:21:43,475 --> 00:21:44,645
as I instructed.

221
00:21:44,725 --> 00:21:46,235
As you wish, Princess.

222
00:21:47,735 --> 00:21:49,275
We do not need the herb, mother.

223
00:21:50,735 --> 00:21:52,325
We need new technology.

224
00:21:52,405 --> 00:21:53,655
What of the Black Panther?

225
00:21:56,865 --> 00:22:00,535
The mantle has unified our nation for centuries.

226
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,785
The Black Panther is a relic, mother.

227
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,375
I wasn't trying to save the mantle with the herb,

228
00:22:05,455 --> 00:22:07,625
I was trying to save my brother.

229
00:22:10,085 --> 00:22:11,085
Oh, Shuri.

230
00:22:24,815 --> 00:22:26,605
Do you know what day it is?

231
00:22:26,685 --> 00:22:27,685
Tuesday.

232
00:22:28,985 --> 00:22:30,485
The date, child.

233
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:37,995
Brother's passing.

234
00:22:38,655 --> 00:22:39,955
One year ago today.

235
00:22:50,085 --> 00:22:51,175
Have you planned anything?

236
00:22:51,255 --> 00:22:55,175
Yes.
It involves you taking your mother for a drive.

237
00:22:55,755 --> 00:22:57,175
- Right now?
- Right now.

238
00:22:57,845 --> 00:22:59,475
And you can leave your kimoyo beads here.

239
00:22:59,555 --> 00:23:00,685
- Mother.
- No, no.

240
00:23:00,765 --> 00:23:02,595
You won't need them where we are going.

241
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:10,315
And the other two. Yes.

242
00:23:34,085 --> 00:23:37,925
You need to sit here with me.
And with yourself.

243
00:23:38,005 --> 00:23:40,595
It is the only way you are going to heal

244
00:23:40,675 --> 00:23:43,015
from the wound caused by T'Challa's death.

245
00:23:43,095 --> 00:23:44,395
I'm fine, mother.

246
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:47,765
You don't have to worry about me.

247
00:23:49,025 --> 00:23:52,645
He's gone, but I'm moving forward.

248
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:54,565
T'Challa is dead,

249
00:23:54,655 --> 00:23:57,525
but that doesn't mean he is gone.

250
00:23:58,025 --> 00:24:00,905
When that illness took your brother from us,

251
00:24:01,075 --> 00:24:05,575
I had to lead a wounded nation and a broken world.

252
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:08,455
But I still took time in the bush.

253
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,875
I wandered until I found water.

254
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:13,415
And I sat.

255
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:16,715
Then I did this ritual

256
00:24:16,885 --> 00:24:19,255
that I am about to show you now.

257
00:24:21,845 --> 00:24:26,055
I found your brother in the breeze,

258
00:24:27,355 --> 00:24:30,725
pushing me gently, but firm.

259
00:24:31,725 --> 00:24:33,895
Like his hand on my shoulder.

260
00:24:36,405 --> 00:24:37,735
It took some time,

261
00:24:39,115 --> 00:24:41,075
but he was there.

262
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,705
He wasn't there, mother.

263
00:24:50,495 --> 00:24:51,955
The presence that you felt

264
00:24:52,045 --> 00:24:53,965
was just a construct of your mind.

265
00:24:56,175 --> 00:24:59,925
Brought on so you could feel some comfort orjoy.

266
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,055
That's all.

267
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:04,805
Hmm.

268
00:25:08,935 --> 00:25:11,815
What construct does your mind create

269
00:25:11,975 --> 00:25:13,935
when you think of your brother?

270
00:25:14,895 --> 00:25:16,855
Does it offer you comfort?

271
00:25:18,235 --> 00:25:19,615
Or torment?

272
00:25:33,295 --> 00:25:34,375
Come, child.

273
00:25:46,135 --> 00:25:47,135
How did you get this?

274
00:25:47,305 --> 00:25:48,435
What does it matter?

275
00:25:49,265 --> 00:25:51,055
What does this have to do with your ritual?

276
00:25:52,225 --> 00:25:54,565
Burning of the funeral garments

277
00:25:54,725 --> 00:25:56,985
marks the end of the mourning period

278
00:25:57,145 --> 00:26:00,065
and the beginning of a new relationship

279
00:26:00,155 --> 00:26:02,405
with our loved ones that have passed on...

280
00:26:02,905 --> 00:26:04,485
I'm not doing this, mother.

281
00:26:05,825 --> 00:26:07,205
If I sit

282
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,915
and think about my brother for too long,

283
00:26:11,415 --> 00:26:14,205
it won't be these clothes I'll burn.

284
00:26:15,455 --> 00:26:17,005
It will be the world...

285
00:26:18,415 --> 00:26:19,965
And everyone in it.

286
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:22,295
Shuri...

287
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:29,685
Shuri, there's something that I need to tell you

288
00:26:30,265 --> 00:26:31,475
about your brother.

289
00:26:36,025 --> 00:26:37,025
Mother, wait!

290
00:26:37,605 --> 00:26:39,565
What are you doing?

291
00:27:04,345 --> 00:27:06,255
This better not be a part of your ritual.

292
00:27:06,345 --> 00:27:07,675
It isn't.

293
00:27:09,305 --> 00:27:10,975
Stop! Right there!

294
00:27:11,635 --> 00:27:14,475
Who are you?
And how did you get in here?

295
00:27:16,015 --> 00:27:17,525
This place is amazing.

296
00:27:18,435 --> 00:27:20,525
The air is pristine.

297
00:27:21,985 --> 00:27:22,985
And the water...

298
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:26,655
My mother told stories about a place like this.

299
00:27:26,985 --> 00:27:30,155
A protected land with people that never have to leave.

300
00:27:30,325 --> 00:27:32,665
That never have to change who they were.

301
00:27:34,245 --> 00:27:35,325
What reason do you have

302
00:27:35,415 --> 00:27:37,205
to reveal your secret to the world?

303
00:27:37,295 --> 00:27:40,255
I am not a woman who enjoys repeating herself.

304
00:27:40,415 --> 00:27:42,295
Who are you?

305
00:27:42,465 --> 00:27:43,675
I have many names.

306
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:47,385
My people call me k'UK'ulkan...

307
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:52,015
But my enemies call me Namor.

308
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,355
The American military detected vibranium

309
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:58,015
under my nation's domain.

310
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:02,565
I was able to stop them from minin' it,

311
00:28:03,485 --> 00:28:04,775
but we need Wakanda's help

312
00:28:04,855 --> 00:28:06,615
to prevent it from happenin' again.

313
00:28:07,735 --> 00:28:10,695
They use a machine designed by an American scientist.

314
00:28:10,865 --> 00:28:13,365
Vibranium only exists here.

315
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:14,865
In Wakanda.

316
00:28:15,035 --> 00:28:16,415
Mother, he's covered in it.

317
00:28:20,295 --> 00:28:24,045
Your son exposed the power of vibranium to the world.

318
00:28:24,585 --> 00:28:26,925
In response, other nations have begun

319
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,425
searching the planet for it.

320
00:28:28,595 --> 00:28:32,015
His choice has compromised us.

321
00:28:32,805 --> 00:28:35,185
I think Wakanda could find the scientist

322
00:28:35,265 --> 00:28:36,555
and bring them to me?

323
00:28:37,305 --> 00:28:41,315
It is only fair that Wakanda helps to resolve our dilemma.

324
00:28:41,475 --> 00:28:43,945
You do not sneak into my country

325
00:28:44,025 --> 00:28:46,735
and tell me what is fair.

326
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:51,285
I have more soldiers than this land has blades of grass.

327
00:28:52,075 --> 00:28:54,785
And they have incomparable strength.

328
00:28:55,285 --> 00:28:58,415
I would hate to come back under different circumstances.

329
00:29:04,415 --> 00:29:06,875
When you have the scientist, blow into this,

330
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,385
place it in the ocean.

331
00:29:08,845 --> 00:29:10,845
I'll be there shortly afterwards.

332
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,595
For your own sake,

333
00:29:16,095 --> 00:29:18,015
don't mention anything about me

334
00:29:18,095 --> 00:29:19,895
to anyone outside of Wakanda.

335
00:29:28,605 --> 00:29:30,525
Did you see the wings on his ankles?

336
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:48,125
How did he do that?

337
00:29:48,885 --> 00:29:50,505
We must convene the council.

338
00:29:52,595 --> 00:29:54,135
Heaven scrapers had no evidence

339
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:55,925
of any activity at all.

340
00:29:58,015 --> 00:30:02,855
Oh, the river border has been breached, huh?

341
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:04,395
If my soldiers were present,

342
00:30:04,815 --> 00:30:07,025
this "fish man"

343
00:30:07,185 --> 00:30:09,025
would be bound before us as we speak.

344
00:30:09,105 --> 00:30:11,365
If your muscle brains were present,

345
00:30:11,525 --> 00:30:12,825
they would still be there

346
00:30:12,905 --> 00:30:14,695
choking on their fuzzy adornments.

347
00:30:14,785 --> 00:30:16,035
You bald-headed demon...

348
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:17,995
Show some respect, you two.

349
00:30:18,075 --> 00:30:19,165
Respect?

350
00:30:19,245 --> 00:30:21,745
These men should be ashamed to show their faces!

351
00:30:21,825 --> 00:30:22,915
Watch your tone, Jabari!

352
00:30:36,345 --> 00:30:37,885
As I was saying,

353
00:30:38,055 --> 00:30:40,845
there was no aerial surveillance footage of him.

354
00:30:40,935 --> 00:30:42,265
And nothing on the radar as well.

355
00:30:42,435 --> 00:30:45,895
So, he swam underwater for 100 kilometers.

356
00:30:46,065 --> 00:30:47,565
He was not alone.

357
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,945
And claims to command a massive army.

358
00:30:50,025 --> 00:30:54,325
He wants us to deliver one American scientist?

359
00:30:54,405 --> 00:30:55,445
So he can kill them?

360
00:30:55,525 --> 00:30:56,615
Do it.

361
00:30:58,905 --> 00:31:00,705
We never had to face an enemy

362
00:31:00,785 --> 00:31:02,535
with access to vibranium before.

363
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:05,495
And we have no Black Panther to protect us.

364
00:31:05,585 --> 00:31:07,205
That is because this wise council

365
00:31:07,295 --> 00:31:09,875
allowed killmonger to take the throne

366
00:31:10,045 --> 00:31:12,045
and burn up all of your precious heart-shaped herb.

367
00:31:12,085 --> 00:31:14,595
M'Baku, what would you have us do?

368
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:17,135
We should find the fish man and kill him.

369
00:31:17,925 --> 00:31:21,885
If we do what he is asking for now,

370
00:31:22,055 --> 00:31:24,475
what is to stop him from coming back

371
00:31:24,555 --> 00:31:26,355
and asking for more?

372
00:31:35,775 --> 00:31:36,825
As you were.

373
00:31:38,535 --> 00:31:42,665
Is it just me, or does this keep getting uglier?

374
00:31:42,995 --> 00:31:43,995
It's you.

375
00:31:44,785 --> 00:31:46,705
- So, does it work?
- Yes.

376
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:48,295
This thing can detect

377
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:50,585
the altered frequency of vibranium

378
00:31:50,755 --> 00:31:53,875
through water, stones, even heavy metals.

379
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:55,755
Whoever built this is brilliant.

380
00:31:56,095 --> 00:31:57,505
Come, look.

381
00:31:58,095 --> 00:32:00,765
Some are custom parts and others look like

382
00:32:00,925 --> 00:32:02,685
they gathered it from a junkyard.

383
00:32:02,845 --> 00:32:05,095
I am still struggling to believe

384
00:32:05,185 --> 00:32:08,145
that vibranium exists outside of Wakanda.

385
00:32:08,315 --> 00:32:10,565
Perhaps there was more than one meteorite.

386
00:32:10,735 --> 00:32:12,445
Our planet is covered of mostly water,

387
00:32:12,525 --> 00:32:13,605
so it's reasonable

388
00:32:13,695 --> 00:32:15,735
that the other one just landed there.

389
00:32:15,905 --> 00:32:17,985
This changes everything that we know.

390
00:32:18,155 --> 00:32:21,615
The great mound.
All of the legends and fables.

391
00:32:22,325 --> 00:32:24,205
Those stories are seared in my mind.

392
00:32:24,365 --> 00:32:26,165
That sounds very painful.

393
00:32:28,455 --> 00:32:30,455
So we have to find this scientist after all.

394
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:33,795
- I do have an idea.
- Mm.

395
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:35,925
I'm going to need the Princess.

396
00:32:36,085 --> 00:32:38,095
Out of the question.

397
00:32:38,175 --> 00:32:40,385
She is in no state to be in the field.

398
00:32:42,765 --> 00:32:45,305
It may do her some good to get out.

399
00:32:45,765 --> 00:32:48,435
It might just be exactly what she needs.

400
00:32:48,975 --> 00:32:51,935
Besides, I can do this American operation

401
00:32:52,025 --> 00:32:53,105
with my eyes closed.

402
00:32:53,185 --> 00:32:56,405
It's not the Americans that I'm worried about.

403
00:32:56,565 --> 00:32:57,985
This Namor,

404
00:32:58,405 --> 00:33:00,405
he snuck past our defenses.

405
00:33:00,485 --> 00:33:02,495
That will never happen again.

406
00:33:02,575 --> 00:33:04,155
He was not alone.

407
00:33:04,905 --> 00:33:06,075
She'll be with me.

408
00:33:07,325 --> 00:33:08,325
So,

409
00:33:09,285 --> 00:33:10,375
when are we leavin'

410
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,625
so I can see my favorite colonizer?

411
00:33:23,385 --> 00:33:24,575
Can't stop

412
00:33:24,595 --> 00:33:26,345
addicted to the shindig

413
00:33:26,435 --> 00:33:28,725
Chop top, he says I'm gonna win big...

414
00:33:30,815 --> 00:33:31,815
Whoa.

415
00:33:31,895 --> 00:33:34,065
Distant cousin to the reservation

416
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:36,815
defunkt the pistol that you pay for

417
00:33:36,895 --> 00:33:39,235
this punk, the feeling that you stay for...

418
00:33:41,445 --> 00:33:42,785
Come on.

419
00:33:44,785 --> 00:33:46,245
Yeah, I got it.

420
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:48,535
I got it.

421
00:33:50,705 --> 00:33:52,035
Will you slow down?

422
00:33:59,005 --> 00:34:00,295
You didn't think to call?

423
00:34:00,465 --> 00:34:01,845
Now, why would I have your number?

424
00:34:04,425 --> 00:34:05,715
We are looking for the scientist

425
00:34:05,805 --> 00:34:07,595
who built the vibranium detector.

426
00:34:08,015 --> 00:34:09,375
So it was you guys in the Atlantic?

427
00:34:10,345 --> 00:34:12,015
Come on. Mining ship.

428
00:34:12,185 --> 00:34:13,435
Lot of casualties.

429
00:34:14,145 --> 00:34:15,145
What happened?

430
00:34:15,315 --> 00:34:16,355
Seriously?

431
00:34:18,355 --> 00:34:21,235
It was a joint operation.
Us and the seals.

432
00:34:21,405 --> 00:34:24,365
Thirty of their top guys, two of our best officers,

433
00:34:24,535 --> 00:34:25,535
friends of mine.

434
00:34:25,995 --> 00:34:26,995
Gone.

435
00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:28,205
Just like that.

436
00:34:28,655 --> 00:34:29,665
You throw in the fact

437
00:34:29,745 --> 00:34:30,805
that they were tracking vibranium...

438
00:34:30,825 --> 00:34:33,495
I can assure you Wakanda had nothing to do with this.

439
00:34:34,415 --> 00:34:35,495
So who was it?

440
00:34:37,085 --> 00:34:38,965
God, look, the way that this is supposed to work

441
00:34:39,045 --> 00:34:41,175
is that I give you information and you reciprocate.

442
00:34:41,255 --> 00:34:43,925
For our own safety, we cannot tell you.

443
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:46,175
It's imperative that we get to the scientist

444
00:34:46,345 --> 00:34:47,845
before anything else happens.

445
00:34:48,675 --> 00:34:50,435
You owe me, Ross.

446
00:34:50,595 --> 00:34:52,095
You owe my brother.

447
00:34:55,935 --> 00:34:56,935
Okay, look.

448
00:34:57,735 --> 00:34:59,985
There are agents who have been sentenced to death

449
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:02,235
for less than I'm about to give you now.

450
00:35:02,405 --> 00:35:03,655
And we got a new director.

451
00:35:04,325 --> 00:35:05,695
She's watching me like a hawk.

452
00:35:05,865 --> 00:35:08,445
We will be very, very careful.

453
00:35:08,615 --> 00:35:10,705
Not just careful, you gotta be fast.

454
00:35:10,785 --> 00:35:12,365
The us needs another machine

455
00:35:12,455 --> 00:35:14,095
and this kid is the only person in the world

456
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:15,375
who knows how to build one.

457
00:35:15,455 --> 00:35:16,495
So they're comin' for her.

458
00:35:16,585 --> 00:35:17,585
A kid?

459
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:29,675
- Hey.
- You forgot to venmo me.

460
00:35:29,765 --> 00:35:33,015
Ah, it slipped my mind.
It's eight hundred, right?

461
00:35:33,095 --> 00:35:34,855
Eight hundred was yesterday's price.

462
00:35:34,935 --> 00:35:36,105
It's a band today.

463
00:35:36,185 --> 00:35:37,895
That's predatory. I...

464
00:35:39,105 --> 00:35:40,855
I built the whole robotic hand.

465
00:35:40,935 --> 00:35:43,485
You just corrected the grip algorithm.

466
00:35:43,655 --> 00:35:45,025
And what grade did you get?

467
00:35:50,745 --> 00:35:52,495
Thanks.

468
00:35:55,495 --> 00:35:56,725
Is that an iPhone I see?

469
00:35:56,745 --> 00:35:57,745
Primitive.

470
00:36:01,295 --> 00:36:03,125
We have located the scientist.

471
00:36:03,215 --> 00:36:04,965
She is in the American equivalent

472
00:36:05,045 --> 00:36:06,795
of a Wakandan village school.

473
00:36:06,885 --> 00:36:08,095
A school?

474
00:36:08,595 --> 00:36:11,015
Please tell me it is a professor.

475
00:36:11,095 --> 00:36:12,975
It's a student, mother.

476
00:36:13,135 --> 00:36:14,555
We can't give her to Namor.

477
00:36:15,395 --> 00:36:18,065
Bring this student back to Wakanda.

478
00:36:23,605 --> 00:36:24,965
I've got it from here.

479
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:27,115
Wait. Maybe I should speak with her.

480
00:36:27,275 --> 00:36:28,575
It will be more discreet.

481
00:36:29,865 --> 00:36:30,995
I can be discreet.

482
00:36:34,745 --> 00:36:35,745
What?

483
00:36:36,165 --> 00:36:37,325
- Nothing.
- Is it the makeup?

484
00:36:38,495 --> 00:36:39,685
It's the wrong shade, isn't it?

485
00:36:39,705 --> 00:36:40,795
It's the right shade.

486
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:42,455
Fenty 440. You look good.

487
00:36:44,085 --> 00:36:46,045
I can blend in as a student.

488
00:36:47,175 --> 00:36:48,175
I can do this.

489
00:36:52,015 --> 00:36:53,515
- You get five minutes.
- Yes!

490
00:37:05,775 --> 00:37:06,775
Yo!

491
00:37:06,945 --> 00:37:08,025
Riri Williams?

492
00:37:11,445 --> 00:37:12,995
Yo, I don't do drop-bys no more.

493
00:37:13,075 --> 00:37:14,195
You gotta go to the website.

494
00:37:15,615 --> 00:37:17,535
It's an encrypted file.

495
00:37:17,705 --> 00:37:18,875
I wanted to airdrop it.

496
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:21,205
You the...

497
00:37:22,755 --> 00:37:23,755
Whew.

498
00:37:23,835 --> 00:37:25,415
You're Princess Shuri.

499
00:37:27,005 --> 00:37:28,585
What the hell are you doing here?

500
00:37:28,755 --> 00:37:30,385
Oh, shit, am I getting recruited?

501
00:37:33,715 --> 00:37:35,515
I'm here about the vibranium detector

502
00:37:35,595 --> 00:37:37,095
that you built for the CIA.

503
00:37:38,595 --> 00:37:40,765
I ain't built no detector for no CIA.

504
00:37:40,855 --> 00:37:42,515
I made that for my metallurgy class.

505
00:37:42,685 --> 00:37:44,685
- A school project?
- Yeah.

506
00:37:45,065 --> 00:37:46,855
My professor said I'd never be able to do it.

507
00:37:48,395 --> 00:37:50,525
To be young, gifted, and black though, right?

508
00:37:53,655 --> 00:37:55,825
Y'all probably don't say that in Wakanda.

509
00:37:58,115 --> 00:37:59,165
How old are you?

510
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,415
Nineteen.

511
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:03,085
Brilliance at a young age

512
00:38:03,165 --> 00:38:05,705
is not always accepted by the elders.

513
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:08,715
How long did it take you?

514
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:09,965
Couple months.

515
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:11,795
- Couple months?
- The hardest part was

516
00:38:11,885 --> 00:38:13,725
finding big enough mylar sheets to cover the...

517
00:38:15,465 --> 00:38:17,015
Wait, did I piss offWakanda?

518
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,185
Not just us.

519
00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:20,265
This place is no longer safe for you.

520
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:23,565
Gather your things and come with me. Right now.

521
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:27,435
I got differential equations class in, like, 15 minutes.

522
00:38:29,945 --> 00:38:30,945
Okay.

523
00:38:32,025 --> 00:38:33,235
Okay.

524
00:38:33,405 --> 00:38:35,615
You wait right here.

525
00:38:36,445 --> 00:38:39,115
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'm just gonna...

526
00:38:39,535 --> 00:38:40,535
Ooh!

527
00:38:42,575 --> 00:38:44,205
I had it under control.

528
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:47,625
I said five minutes.
I gave you six.

529
00:38:47,795 --> 00:38:49,465
Get out. Get out of my dorm.

530
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:51,295
Get out!

531
00:38:51,465 --> 00:38:52,465
Hey.

532
00:38:52,635 --> 00:38:55,465
I'm warning you!
Do not take another step

533
00:38:55,555 --> 00:38:56,555
- toward me!
- Oh!

534
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:57,865
See how they teach the children

535
00:38:57,885 --> 00:38:59,175
to treat their guests? Mm!

536
00:39:03,105 --> 00:39:04,185
Oh...

537
00:39:04,265 --> 00:39:05,605
You brought a spear in here?

538
00:39:05,685 --> 00:39:08,065
You brought a spear in here.

539
00:39:08,775 --> 00:39:09,895
I like her.

540
00:39:10,395 --> 00:39:11,565
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

541
00:39:11,645 --> 00:39:13,215
- Put it down, put it...
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

542
00:39:13,235 --> 00:39:14,825
You'll hurt yourself. Come on.

543
00:39:14,905 --> 00:39:16,575
It's all right, Princess.

544
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:17,995
Small, small girl.

545
00:39:19,075 --> 00:39:21,995
I am going to give you two options.

546
00:39:22,165 --> 00:39:24,325
You can come to Wakanda,

547
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,795
conscious or unconscious.

548
00:39:27,585 --> 00:39:30,335
You need to be conscious of the way that you look.

549
00:39:30,505 --> 00:39:32,465
Walking round here, all that ash on your head.

550
00:39:34,385 --> 00:39:36,425
- Oh, it's funny?
- No, it's not.

551
00:39:36,635 --> 00:39:38,965
- Mm-hmm. I told you!
- You look good.

552
00:39:39,135 --> 00:39:40,805
Calm down. We'll leave, okay?

553
00:39:41,265 --> 00:39:42,635
And she can deal

554
00:39:42,725 --> 00:39:45,395
with that merman with the winged ankles

555
00:39:45,555 --> 00:39:48,475
who wants to kill her all by herself.

556
00:39:48,645 --> 00:39:50,775
- You got this.
- Mm, with your heater.

557
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,295
Come on. Let's go.

558
00:39:53,025 --> 00:39:54,025
What?

559
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:02,865
What exactly is this place?

560
00:40:03,575 --> 00:40:05,695
I fixed a few trucks for the head of sanitation.

561
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:10,165
He lets me work out of this garage in exchange.

562
00:40:10,665 --> 00:40:12,255
I just have to grab my work laptop.

563
00:40:14,965 --> 00:40:17,755
Please don't touch anything.

564
00:40:17,925 --> 00:40:20,055
You don't have to worry about that.

565
00:40:20,215 --> 00:40:21,635
It may not look like much,

566
00:40:21,725 --> 00:40:23,725
but it's my life's work in here.

567
00:40:23,805 --> 00:40:24,805
Mm-hmm.

568
00:40:24,895 --> 00:40:28,315
So, the design for the machine is on that laptop?

569
00:40:28,475 --> 00:40:29,475
Yeah.

570
00:40:29,565 --> 00:40:32,525
And you just leave it on a desk in a car garage?

571
00:40:32,685 --> 00:40:35,655
I got 2065-byte encryption on that thing.

572
00:40:35,815 --> 00:40:38,945
That's impressive.
Ever locked yourself out?

573
00:40:39,115 --> 00:40:41,035
Took me the whole semester to get back in.

574
00:40:41,195 --> 00:40:43,245
Had to build a functional quantum computer

575
00:40:43,405 --> 00:40:45,325
just to crack my own encryption.

576
00:40:45,495 --> 00:40:47,875
What is it you're building here? Is it stark tech?

577
00:40:47,955 --> 00:40:49,375
I said don't touch anything.

578
00:40:49,455 --> 00:40:51,165
Princess, American law enforcement

579
00:40:51,255 --> 00:40:52,625
has arrived at your location.

580
00:40:52,705 --> 00:40:54,165
- Shit.
- Who was that?

581
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:55,585
My ai.

582
00:40:57,215 --> 00:40:58,675
They are surrounding us.

583
00:41:02,675 --> 00:41:05,305
I thought you said a merman was after me.

584
00:41:05,475 --> 00:41:06,515
That's the feds.

585
00:41:19,905 --> 00:41:22,405
Oh, I do not need this shit right now!

586
00:41:22,485 --> 00:41:24,705
I swear to god, I was doing so well!

587
00:41:24,865 --> 00:41:27,495
Goin' to class on time.
I must be dumb as hell.

588
00:41:27,575 --> 00:41:30,205
Real dumb thinking that the Princess of Wakanda

589
00:41:30,285 --> 00:41:31,955
is gonna show up at my doorstep

590
00:41:32,045 --> 00:41:33,665
and then shit about to pop off.

591
00:41:33,755 --> 00:41:34,755
I think

592
00:41:34,835 --> 00:41:37,505
that I'm actually gonna take my chances with this merman,

593
00:41:37,585 --> 00:41:41,305
because at least he never brought the FBI to my garage!

594
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:44,885
Hey. Namor sank an entire ship of CIA operatives...

595
00:41:44,975 --> 00:41:46,445
This is the federal bureau

596
00:41:46,475 --> 00:41:47,475
of in vestigation.

597
00:41:47,555 --> 00:41:48,655
Because of your little machine.

598
00:41:48,685 --> 00:41:50,055
So those popo out there...

599
00:41:50,145 --> 00:41:51,325
We have surrounded the premises.

600
00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:52,495
Are the very least of your worries.

601
00:41:52,515 --> 00:41:55,065
Listen, we need to work together to get out of here.

602
00:41:55,235 --> 00:41:57,645
General, they've got us surrounded.

603
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,405
Maybe we should just split up.

604
00:41:59,485 --> 00:42:00,985
Out of the question.

605
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:02,275
Does this vehicle work?

606
00:42:05,865 --> 00:42:09,165
Everything in this lab works.
Including this bike.

607
00:42:09,325 --> 00:42:11,165
Don't even think about it.

608
00:42:11,245 --> 00:42:13,335
Besides, there are three of us.

609
00:42:13,495 --> 00:42:15,955
Two of y'all. I'm takin' this.

610
00:42:16,335 --> 00:42:17,585
Whoo!

611
00:42:17,665 --> 00:42:18,915
I knew it.

612
00:42:19,085 --> 00:42:21,505
Don't tell me that you built this in two months.

613
00:42:21,595 --> 00:42:24,635
I spent years on this. On and off.

614
00:42:24,715 --> 00:42:27,595
Nice. Have you flown it yet?

615
00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:28,885
That thing can fly?

616
00:42:28,975 --> 00:42:30,935
There's an entire YouTube channel

617
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,805
dedicated to sightings of me.

618
00:42:32,895 --> 00:42:33,975
That's awesome.

619
00:42:34,435 --> 00:42:35,785
We have a warrant to detain...

620
00:42:35,815 --> 00:42:37,575
- Come.
- The student Riri Williams.

621
00:42:37,645 --> 00:42:38,855
Wireless transmitter,

622
00:42:38,935 --> 00:42:40,025
so we can communicate.

623
00:42:40,105 --> 00:42:41,235
Don't try to scurry off.

624
00:42:41,315 --> 00:42:43,445
General Okoye, Princess Shuri,

625
00:42:43,615 --> 00:42:45,655
come out with your hands up.

626
00:42:46,365 --> 00:42:47,495
What a hunk of junk.

627
00:42:47,575 --> 00:42:49,455
Hey, please be careful.

628
00:42:49,535 --> 00:42:50,885
You will not be placed under arrest.

629
00:42:50,915 --> 00:42:51,915
Keys are on the seat.

630
00:42:52,075 --> 00:42:53,685
Once we get to the other side of the bridge,

631
00:42:53,705 --> 00:42:55,015
we can lose them in Boston traffic.

632
00:42:55,045 --> 00:42:56,915
General, we really need to split up.

633
00:42:57,085 --> 00:42:59,165
Listen to me.
We are not in your lab.

634
00:42:59,255 --> 00:43:00,335
We are in the field.

635
00:43:00,505 --> 00:43:01,925
Now, get her in the car.

636
00:43:02,505 --> 00:43:03,635
Always shouting at me.

637
00:43:10,435 --> 00:43:12,595
The tactical unit will breach the entrance

638
00:43:12,685 --> 00:43:15,565
in three, two,

639
00:43:15,725 --> 00:43:17,065
one.

640
00:43:18,435 --> 00:43:20,065
FBI! Don't move!

641
00:43:20,735 --> 00:43:21,855
What the hell is that?

642
00:43:21,895 --> 00:43:24,235
Oh, shit!
She got an iron man suit?

643
00:43:24,315 --> 00:43:26,275
- Fall back!
- Stay where you are!

644
00:43:29,825 --> 00:43:30,955
Guess it can fly.

645
00:43:31,035 --> 00:43:32,415
- Griot!
- Yes, Princess.

646
00:43:32,495 --> 00:43:34,125
- Now!
- Remote piloting activated.

647
00:43:34,205 --> 00:43:35,455
Shuri! No!

648
00:43:39,835 --> 00:43:43,135
Clip, pole, smoke, fade

649
00:43:43,215 --> 00:43:44,295
they want the drip

650
00:43:44,385 --> 00:43:46,845
Let's go!

651
00:43:48,055 --> 00:43:49,055
Griot.

652
00:43:50,225 --> 00:43:51,515
Give me a visual.

653
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:52,945
They want the glow they want my soul

654
00:43:52,975 --> 00:43:54,515
they want the wave 1 keep a clip

655
00:43:54,595 --> 00:43:55,605
I keep a pole

656
00:43:55,685 --> 00:43:57,975
who want the smoke who want the fade

657
00:43:59,605 --> 00:44:01,025
- Griot...
- Yes, general?

658
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,985
Take me to the Princess

659
00:44:03,155 --> 00:44:05,815
or I will drive my spear so deep into your cpu,

660
00:44:05,985 --> 00:44:07,275
you will not be able to process

661
00:44:07,365 --> 00:44:09,155
basic input for a millennia.

662
00:44:09,325 --> 00:44:10,605
Just one moment, general.

663
00:44:10,745 --> 00:44:12,115
Okoye, I'm on my way to you.

664
00:44:12,205 --> 00:44:14,205
Bounce, crouch or get slouched

665
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:15,575
my whole hood devout

666
00:44:17,785 --> 00:44:19,205
My mama taught me not to be a harlot

667
00:44:19,295 --> 00:44:21,335
my granny help me take the wise route

668
00:44:21,415 --> 00:44:23,175
although I'm itty bitty sitting pretty

669
00:44:23,255 --> 00:44:26,385
Griot, give me control of this vehicle right now!

670
00:44:26,545 --> 00:44:28,595
I am clearing you a path.

671
00:44:33,385 --> 00:44:34,725
She's all yours, general.

672
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:36,685
Manual drive engaged.

673
00:44:47,275 --> 00:44:49,445
Look, I know you on my bumper

674
00:44:49,525 --> 00:44:51,325
I know you want my thunder

675
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:53,325
why the laws wanna take us under

676
00:44:53,405 --> 00:44:54,865
we need to find an extraction point.

677
00:44:55,035 --> 00:44:56,535
There's one across the river.

678
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:58,245
I know you want my thunder

679
00:44:58,335 --> 00:45:00,085
why the laws wanna take us under

680
00:45:00,165 --> 00:45:02,045
why the hell am I in this jungle

681
00:45:02,755 --> 00:45:04,255
hey, yo, they cuttin' off the bridge.

682
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,635
Princess, there is a surveillance drone

683
00:45:10,715 --> 00:45:12,515
- locked onto you.
- How high?

684
00:45:12,675 --> 00:45:14,015
Thirty-thousand feet.

685
00:45:14,635 --> 00:45:16,475
We don't cry 'bout how they try take us all out

686
00:45:16,935 --> 00:45:18,435
-look -they want the drip

687
00:45:18,935 --> 00:45:19,935
they want my soul

688
00:45:20,015 --> 00:45:21,015
hang on.

689
00:45:21,725 --> 00:45:22,725
I got it.

690
00:45:26,395 --> 00:45:27,405
Come on, Riri.

691
00:45:27,815 --> 00:45:30,075
You gotta find these differential equations.

692
00:45:30,235 --> 00:45:32,035
Once the relative velocity evens out...

693
00:45:32,115 --> 00:45:34,075
Riri, I'm not sure you can reach that drone

694
00:45:34,155 --> 00:45:35,155
without an oxygen mask.

695
00:45:37,785 --> 00:45:40,455
Oxygen level is now 55%.

696
00:45:41,415 --> 00:45:43,545
Twenty-eight thousand feet.

697
00:45:44,665 --> 00:45:47,255
Oxygen level is now 30%.

698
00:45:50,385 --> 00:45:51,815
Maximum acceleration.
I just need to adjust

699
00:45:51,845 --> 00:45:53,385
my euler angles and that should...

700
00:45:54,135 --> 00:45:55,495
That should drop it right on the...

701
00:46:01,895 --> 00:46:03,725
Oxygen, 0%.

702
00:46:07,105 --> 00:46:09,065
The drone is no longer tracking you.

703
00:46:09,985 --> 00:46:11,985
Altitude, 500 feet and falling.

704
00:46:12,075 --> 00:46:13,515
Riri! Are you okay?

705
00:46:14,655 --> 00:46:15,695
- Riri!
- Yea h.

706
00:46:19,285 --> 00:46:20,375
I'm good.

707
00:46:21,285 --> 00:46:23,045
- Incoming!
- Get out of the way!

708
00:46:23,745 --> 00:46:24,855
- Shit!
- And no worries.

709
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:26,875
I got a special delivery for y'all in three,

710
00:46:27,045 --> 00:46:28,465
two, one...

711
00:46:30,005 --> 00:46:31,085
Nice one, Riri!

712
00:46:31,175 --> 00:46:32,505
We got the glow we got the soul

713
00:46:32,595 --> 00:46:33,805
we got the wave

714
00:46:33,885 --> 00:46:35,345
Whool

715
00:46:40,345 --> 00:46:41,395
Riri!

716
00:47:08,415 --> 00:47:11,505
What just happened? Shun!

717
00:47:12,045 --> 00:47:13,045
Shun!

718
00:47:29,145 --> 00:47:31,395
The Princess's vitals are stable, general.

719
00:47:31,565 --> 00:47:34,155
She should regain consciousness momentarily.

720
00:48:08,605 --> 00:48:10,685
Take another step closer

721
00:48:11,485 --> 00:48:12,985
and iwill kill you all.

722
00:48:13,695 --> 00:48:15,255
Drop your weapons!

723
00:48:23,495 --> 00:48:24,695
Hey, is she blue?

724
00:48:29,495 --> 00:48:30,695
Drop your weapon!

725
00:50:44,595 --> 00:50:45,675
Okoye!

726
00:50:47,175 --> 00:50:48,175
Wait!

727
00:50:48,265 --> 00:50:49,635
Activating interpretation.

728
00:50:49,725 --> 00:50:50,955
I'm Shuri.

729
00:50:50,975 --> 00:50:52,265
Princess of Wakanda.

730
00:50:52,725 --> 00:50:54,515
I demand that you take me to Namor.

731
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:56,775
Do not bring harm to this girl.

732
00:50:59,485 --> 00:51:01,565
Do we take them both alive?

733
00:51:01,865 --> 00:51:04,155
Yes, attuma.

734
00:51:20,465 --> 00:51:21,585
Breathe.

735
00:51:30,515 --> 00:51:31,515
Shun!

736
00:51:49,945 --> 00:51:52,615
Ross, from the agency.
You got any witnesses?

737
00:51:52,785 --> 00:51:54,995
None. But we think it was the Wakandans.

738
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:56,375
Excuse me?

739
00:51:56,455 --> 00:51:57,645
Our field office got a tip from Langley

740
00:51:57,665 --> 00:51:58,665
that they were coming.

741
00:51:58,835 --> 00:52:00,625
Right. Who made that call?

742
00:52:01,665 --> 00:52:03,265
- She did.
- Director de Fontaine.

743
00:52:05,465 --> 00:52:06,845
Director de fontaine.

744
00:52:06,925 --> 00:52:07,925
Really?

745
00:52:08,005 --> 00:52:09,015
Well...

746
00:52:10,015 --> 00:52:11,885
Uh, agent thinks it was the Wakandans.

747
00:52:12,435 --> 00:52:13,935
Yeah, we've been on every one of them

748
00:52:14,015 --> 00:52:15,075
since they took out our ship.

749
00:52:15,095 --> 00:52:16,515
That's why I wanted you here.

750
00:52:17,605 --> 00:52:18,685
You're lookin' good.

751
00:52:18,775 --> 00:52:20,355
Oh. Well, I try.

752
00:52:20,525 --> 00:52:22,025
You put that home gym in?

753
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:23,105
Yeah. Last year.

754
00:52:23,275 --> 00:52:25,985
Maybe I'll drop by sometime and jump on your peloton.

755
00:52:26,735 --> 00:52:27,735
Howdy.

756
00:52:27,825 --> 00:52:29,635
- I'm special agent in charge.
- Oh, good for you.

757
00:52:29,655 --> 00:52:31,825
You wanna walk me through the evidence here, or what?

758
00:52:31,995 --> 00:52:34,165
- Yeah. Okay. After you.
- Yeah. Okay.

759
00:52:34,245 --> 00:52:35,725
- All right.
- So, what happened here?

760
00:52:36,075 --> 00:52:37,665
Um, we think it was a car crash,

761
00:52:37,835 --> 00:52:39,585
but we're having trouble finding the cars.

762
00:52:39,665 --> 00:52:40,765
What do you mean?

763
00:52:40,795 --> 00:52:42,145
It was just like this when you found it?

764
00:52:42,165 --> 00:52:43,855
Yes.
We think someone involved

765
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:44,875
got rid of the vehicles.

766
00:52:44,965 --> 00:52:46,195
Got rid of them how?

767
00:52:46,215 --> 00:52:47,815
They dumped them into the river.

768
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:49,085
You're kidding me.

769
00:52:50,095 --> 00:52:51,675
It's got an mit sticker on it.

770
00:52:51,845 --> 00:52:54,225
I want that transferred to the NSA immediately.

771
00:52:54,385 --> 00:52:56,475
Hey, Ross?
You got a full tank of gas?

772
00:52:56,645 --> 00:52:58,305
Can you give me a ride back to Langley?

773
00:52:58,395 --> 00:53:00,605
It's an eight-hour drive.

774
00:53:00,685 --> 00:53:02,205
Yeah.
We can talk about the case.

775
00:53:02,235 --> 00:53:04,605
Actually, wouldn't mind...

776
00:53:04,695 --> 00:53:06,855
Apologizing to you for a couple of things I said

777
00:53:06,945 --> 00:53:07,985
during our marriage.

778
00:53:11,365 --> 00:53:12,615
They were blue.

779
00:53:13,655 --> 00:53:15,495
And they had superhuman strength.

780
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:19,245
And they came from the water on the backs of whales.

781
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:21,795
I struck down three of them

782
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:23,355
with blows that should've killed them,

783
00:53:23,415 --> 00:53:25,125
but they Rose again.

784
00:53:25,295 --> 00:53:28,545
I wish to leave immediately to retrieve our Princess.

785
00:53:40,355 --> 00:53:41,565
Okoye,

786
00:53:41,935 --> 00:53:44,355
you will be stripped of your rank

787
00:53:44,435 --> 00:53:46,445
as general of Wakanda's armies

788
00:53:46,525 --> 00:53:49,485
and your status as dora milaje.

789
00:53:57,785 --> 00:53:58,825
You may.

790
00:54:02,795 --> 00:54:04,255
I have given everything.

791
00:54:05,205 --> 00:54:09,005
Let me die saving my country and that throne.

792
00:54:11,345 --> 00:54:13,135
Allow me to make this right.

793
00:54:13,215 --> 00:54:14,515
"Make it right"?

794
00:54:16,135 --> 00:54:19,265
I do not know if my daughter is alive or dead.

795
00:54:19,435 --> 00:54:22,685
Perhaps we are being too hasty.

796
00:54:22,765 --> 00:54:24,105
Mmm.

797
00:54:24,775 --> 00:54:29,155
She raised a spear against her own husband for Wakanda.

798
00:54:29,315 --> 00:54:31,865
Where is her treacherous husband now

799
00:54:32,025 --> 00:54:36,325
but in a place where she can visit if she wished?
Mine...

800
00:54:37,615 --> 00:54:39,495
Is with the ancestors.

801
00:54:39,575 --> 00:54:44,375
I am queen of the most powerful nation in the world,

802
00:54:44,545 --> 00:54:47,755
and my entire family is gone!

803
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:51,385
Have I not given everything?

804
00:55:00,555 --> 00:55:02,475
On your feet, general.

805
00:55:08,645 --> 00:55:10,855
I stood by you

806
00:55:11,025 --> 00:55:14,655
after killmonger took the throne,

807
00:55:14,825 --> 00:55:18,405
and you and the elders in this room stood by him

808
00:55:18,575 --> 00:55:22,205
while I ran begging to the Jabari for protection.

809
00:55:23,575 --> 00:55:24,995
And I warned you

810
00:55:25,085 --> 00:55:27,955
about taking my daughter on this mission,

811
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:30,045
and you lost her.

812
00:55:30,795 --> 00:55:32,295
So, today,

813
00:55:33,215 --> 00:55:35,385
I am done.

814
00:56:21,475 --> 00:56:24,015
Are you here, Griot?

815
00:56:25,345 --> 00:56:26,605
Yes, my queen.

816
00:56:27,645 --> 00:56:31,025
Were you with Shuri when she was abducted?

817
00:56:31,185 --> 00:56:32,485
I was.

818
00:56:32,645 --> 00:56:35,405
Are you able to track her kimoyo beads?

819
00:56:35,565 --> 00:56:37,985
Ballistics found slugs all over Cambridge.

820
00:56:38,075 --> 00:56:40,155
Those Wakandans really took a tour of the city.

821
00:56:40,235 --> 00:56:41,245
Hmm.

822
00:56:41,325 --> 00:56:43,125
I can't see how they figured out who built it.

823
00:56:43,155 --> 00:56:45,575
That information is highly classified.

824
00:56:48,835 --> 00:56:49,835
What is that?

825
00:56:49,915 --> 00:56:51,335
- That's a new ringtone?
- Oh, shit.

826
00:56:52,665 --> 00:56:54,755
Uh, director, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to take this.

827
00:56:54,835 --> 00:56:56,045
It's enough with the titles.

828
00:56:56,135 --> 00:56:57,295
Just take it. I don't care.

829
00:56:57,385 --> 00:56:58,595
Hey, honey sweetheart.

830
00:56:58,675 --> 00:57:00,305
Ooh.

831
00:57:00,385 --> 00:57:02,925
Uh, no, I'm...
I'm with my boss. Now.

832
00:57:03,635 --> 00:57:05,015
Actually, she's leaving.

833
00:57:05,185 --> 00:57:06,185
All right.

834
00:57:06,345 --> 00:57:08,805
I'm gonna work from home, and then have a shower.

835
00:57:16,195 --> 00:57:17,695
Everett Ross.

836
00:57:17,865 --> 00:57:18,985
Queen Ramonda?

837
00:57:19,155 --> 00:57:21,115
What are you doing with Shuri's kimoyo beads?

838
00:57:21,195 --> 00:57:23,155
I didn't know they were hers.
All right?

839
00:57:23,245 --> 00:57:25,495
I just found them at a pretty ugly crime scene.

840
00:57:26,535 --> 00:57:27,665
Do you have the student?

841
00:57:28,535 --> 00:57:31,495
Shuri was trying to save her when they were both taken.

842
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,875
What? Taken by who?

843
00:57:35,465 --> 00:57:37,505
My agency assumes it was you.

844
00:57:37,585 --> 00:57:39,635
And I'm worried they might be onto the fact

845
00:57:39,715 --> 00:57:41,965
that I pointed Shuri and Okoye in the right direction.

846
00:57:42,135 --> 00:57:43,845
Look, if they're in danger, I wanna help.

847
00:57:43,925 --> 00:57:45,845
But I can't if I don't know what's going on.

848
00:57:46,015 --> 00:57:48,725
I am afraid there is a new world power at play.

849
00:57:49,145 --> 00:57:51,105
A country that's already on our radar?

850
00:57:51,185 --> 00:57:52,185
Or you mean someone else?

851
00:57:52,275 --> 00:57:54,275
That is all I can say for now.

852
00:57:54,435 --> 00:57:55,435
Please,

853
00:57:55,855 --> 00:57:58,525
alert me if your government decides to act

854
00:57:58,605 --> 00:58:00,195
on their suspicions.

855
00:58:00,275 --> 00:58:01,445
Yeah. Sure.

856
00:58:02,025 --> 00:58:06,035
Uh, look, if there's anything I can do to help, let me know.

857
00:58:06,205 --> 00:58:07,995
I owe Shuri my life.

858
00:58:08,745 --> 00:58:12,665
Griot, did Shuri have her earrings with her?

859
00:58:12,835 --> 00:58:15,375
I lost track of them in the north Atlantic,

860
00:58:15,545 --> 00:58:18,715
but the people who took her spoke yucatec Mayan.

861
00:59:06,965 --> 00:59:08,845
- Hmm?
- Oui, Miss Makia.

862
00:59:19,315 --> 00:59:20,565
Queen mother.

863
00:59:22,405 --> 00:59:24,695
Everything is a lesson here for the children.

864
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:27,865
They painted the walls, they feed the fish,

865
00:59:28,035 --> 00:59:30,325
and they grow everything we eat here.

866
00:59:30,495 --> 00:59:33,125
I recognize some of the concepts here.

867
00:59:33,285 --> 00:59:35,245
But you are using different material.

868
00:59:35,415 --> 00:59:38,755
Yes, we use strictly what we can find here in Haiti.

869
00:59:40,755 --> 00:59:44,095
You were missed at T'Challa's funeral.

870
00:59:55,855 --> 00:59:57,065
Queen mother.

871
00:59:57,225 --> 01:00:00,185
It's been six years since you left us.

872
01:00:00,355 --> 01:00:03,525
I thought you would at least come back for the ceremony.

873
01:00:06,275 --> 01:00:07,785
I was afraid

874
01:00:08,655 --> 01:00:12,455
of how final the funeral would be.

875
01:00:12,535 --> 01:00:15,575
Nakia, daughter of yaa,

876
01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:20,755
wherever you go, you are still Wakandan,

877
01:00:20,915 --> 01:00:24,545
and you know death is not the end.

878
01:00:35,685 --> 01:00:37,435
How is everyone at home?

879
01:00:37,605 --> 01:00:39,935
Shuri has been taken.

880
01:00:40,645 --> 01:00:41,645
What?

881
01:00:42,065 --> 01:00:45,065
You have infiltrated many nations before.

882
01:00:47,485 --> 01:00:48,885
I was a different person then.

883
01:00:48,905 --> 01:00:51,945
I need someone who can find where she is being held,

884
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:55,165
and rescue her, without being seen.

885
01:00:55,535 --> 01:00:58,375
Who on earth would risk war with Wakanda?

886
01:01:00,755 --> 01:01:01,835
Oh, my god.

887
01:01:01,915 --> 01:01:03,215
Okay, breathe. Breathe.

888
01:01:03,295 --> 01:01:04,755
Oh, don't tell me to breathe.

889
01:01:04,925 --> 01:01:05,925
Where the hell are we?

890
01:01:06,085 --> 01:01:08,215
We're in a cave.
I'm not sure where.

891
01:01:08,295 --> 01:01:09,305
Oh, my god!

892
01:01:09,845 --> 01:01:11,425
What is that?

893
01:01:11,595 --> 01:01:14,345
Glow worms.
Their larva gives off light.

894
01:01:14,435 --> 01:01:16,345
Just calm down.

895
01:01:16,765 --> 01:01:18,645
Okay, is there, like, a new Black Panther

896
01:01:18,725 --> 01:01:20,165
that you can call to come and get us?

897
01:01:21,145 --> 01:01:22,145
Why not?

898
01:01:22,225 --> 01:01:24,025
Because it doesn't work like that anymore.

899
01:01:24,775 --> 01:01:26,355
The Black Panther is gone.

900
01:01:27,025 --> 01:01:28,175
So y'all stopped having Black Panthers

901
01:01:28,195 --> 01:01:29,195
when I get kidnapped?

902
01:01:42,295 --> 01:01:44,465
Do you understand her?

903
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:46,125
Not completely.

904
01:01:48,215 --> 01:01:49,425
Nuh-uh.

905
01:01:49,595 --> 01:01:51,925
That is some supervillain shit right there.

906
01:01:52,095 --> 01:01:53,425
That's in every movie.

907
01:01:53,595 --> 01:01:54,845
Princess Leia.

908
01:01:55,015 --> 01:01:56,295
Belle from beauty and the beast.

909
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:58,975
That white chick from Indiana Jones.

910
01:01:59,055 --> 01:02:00,185
It's fine.

911
01:02:00,265 --> 01:02:02,815
You should see what I have to wear at warrior falls.

912
01:02:11,235 --> 01:02:12,655
Wait.

913
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:15,195
You're not leaving me in here, are you?

914
01:02:15,285 --> 01:02:16,745
I'm coming back.

915
01:02:17,405 --> 01:02:18,615
I'm coming back.

916
01:02:18,785 --> 01:02:20,705
Stay calm.

917
01:04:29,755 --> 01:04:31,375
Princess.

918
01:04:31,545 --> 01:04:32,545
Welcome.

919
01:04:34,505 --> 01:04:36,965
Please, feel free.

920
01:04:44,225 --> 01:04:45,515
This is beautiful.

921
01:04:46,355 --> 01:04:48,105
That was my mother's.

922
01:04:58,155 --> 01:05:00,695
These are all mesoamerican artifacts.

923
01:05:02,155 --> 01:05:04,035
Most likely 16th century.

924
01:05:05,245 --> 01:05:07,455
Have you been alive since then?

925
01:05:09,415 --> 01:05:10,955
Your mother was human.

926
01:05:12,415 --> 01:05:13,415
She was.

927
01:05:13,585 --> 01:05:15,795
Then she became something else.

928
01:05:15,965 --> 01:05:18,005
- How?
- "How?"

929
01:05:18,595 --> 01:05:21,055
"How" is never
as important as "why."

930
01:05:32,315 --> 01:05:33,775
My mother and her village

931
01:05:33,855 --> 01:05:35,445
were driven from their farms

932
01:05:35,605 --> 01:05:39,365
by Spanish conquistadors who brought the smallpox,

933
01:05:39,525 --> 01:05:42,405
a hateful language, and dogma from another world.

934
01:05:44,195 --> 01:05:45,905
Facing starvation,

935
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:47,915
war, and disease,

936
01:05:48,375 --> 01:05:50,165
my people turned to chaac...

937
01:05:51,835 --> 01:05:53,705
Our god of rain and abundance.

938
01:05:55,915 --> 01:05:58,755
Chaac gave our shaman a vision...

939
01:05:58,835 --> 01:06:01,505
A way to save his people.

940
01:06:05,515 --> 01:06:09,895
Chaac led him to a plant sprouting from a blue rock.

941
01:06:23,365 --> 01:06:25,575
My mother was pregnant with me at the time,

942
01:06:25,745 --> 01:06:27,995
and she did not want to ingest the plant

943
01:06:28,165 --> 01:06:30,375
for fear of what it may do to me.

944
01:06:32,535 --> 01:06:34,415
But the shaman was convincing.

945
01:07:06,285 --> 01:07:08,115
They all fell sick.

946
01:07:09,285 --> 01:07:11,125
And their lives,

947
01:07:11,285 --> 01:07:13,415
their existence there,

948
01:07:13,585 --> 01:07:14,875
ended.

949
01:07:26,765 --> 01:07:29,015
The plant took away their ability to breathe air

950
01:07:29,175 --> 01:07:32,975
but enabled them to draw oxygen from the sea.

951
01:07:36,315 --> 01:07:38,065
They settled in the ocean,

952
01:07:38,735 --> 01:07:41,855
away from war and diseases.

953
01:08:11,015 --> 01:08:13,185
My mother gave birth to me there

954
01:08:13,475 --> 01:08:16,725
and I became the firstborn son of Talokan.

955
01:08:17,185 --> 01:08:19,275
The plant gave me wings on my ankles

956
01:08:19,435 --> 01:08:21,855
and ears that pointed to the clouds.

957
01:08:22,315 --> 01:08:23,565
I was a mutant.

958
01:08:24,485 --> 01:08:27,735
I could swim in the sky and age slower.

959
01:08:27,905 --> 01:08:30,405
Breathe the air our ancestors breathed.

960
01:08:31,655 --> 01:08:33,245
As she grew older,

961
01:08:34,575 --> 01:08:38,165
my mother mourned the life on land that she once knew...

962
01:08:40,085 --> 01:08:41,835
And died with a broken heart.

963
01:08:44,585 --> 01:08:46,215
She made me promise

964
01:08:46,295 --> 01:08:48,555
to Bury her in the soil of her homeland.

965
01:08:53,675 --> 01:08:56,595
Nothing could prepare me for what I found there.

966
01:09:42,935 --> 01:09:44,945
A Spanish man of faith cursed me.

967
01:09:45,105 --> 01:09:46,985
As he died by my hand,

968
01:09:47,155 --> 01:09:48,195
he called me...

969
01:09:53,615 --> 01:09:55,825
The child without love.

970
01:09:56,365 --> 01:09:57,825
And I took my name from there.

971
01:10:03,205 --> 01:10:04,915
"Namor."

972
01:10:05,085 --> 01:10:07,925
Because I have no love for the surface world.

973
01:10:09,925 --> 01:10:12,005
Why are you telling me all of this?

974
01:10:13,425 --> 01:10:16,555
So that you can understand why I have to kill the scientist.

975
01:10:16,725 --> 01:10:18,305
What if we took her to Wakanda?

976
01:10:19,685 --> 01:10:20,895
Let us go.

977
01:10:21,855 --> 01:10:23,315
I give you my word.

978
01:10:23,475 --> 01:10:24,935
She will remain in my country.

979
01:10:25,145 --> 01:10:26,605
I cannot risk that, Princess.

980
01:10:26,775 --> 01:10:28,405
Then keep me instead.

981
01:10:30,365 --> 01:10:31,985
I'd love to see your nation.

982
01:10:33,325 --> 01:10:35,945
Well, you can't go down there in that.

983
01:10:37,995 --> 01:10:41,455
Hypothermia will grip you almost instantaneously.

984
01:10:41,625 --> 01:10:43,875
Your blood will become toxic

985
01:10:43,955 --> 01:10:45,375
and the pressure of the ocean

986
01:10:45,455 --> 01:10:47,875
will break every bone in your body.

987
01:10:50,965 --> 01:10:52,485
Or you can wear a suit.

988
01:10:52,635 --> 01:10:54,385
We have some of them. Come on.

989
01:10:57,475 --> 01:10:58,475
Stay close.

990
01:12:02,825 --> 01:12:04,495
Hey! Namor, wait!

991
01:12:49,545 --> 01:12:50,665
Whoa!

992
01:14:08,075 --> 01:14:09,535
Hello.

993
01:14:38,105 --> 01:14:39,235
It's beautiful.

994
01:14:41,065 --> 01:14:42,405
It's made of vibranium.

995
01:14:42,575 --> 01:14:43,575
Yes.

996
01:14:43,655 --> 01:14:45,245
In the depths of the ocean,

997
01:14:45,655 --> 01:14:47,905
I brought the sun to my people.

998
01:14:49,995 --> 01:14:51,125
I know you wished me

999
01:14:51,205 --> 01:14:53,455
to spare the life of the scientist.

1000
01:14:53,835 --> 01:14:56,085
But now you see what I have to protect.

1001
01:15:20,905 --> 01:15:22,985
Nakia, your hunch was correct.

1002
01:15:23,155 --> 01:15:26,155
I have picked up a location on Shuri's kimoyo earrings.

1003
01:15:59,525 --> 01:16:02,155
The signal is coming from an underwater cavern

1004
01:16:02,315 --> 01:16:05,775
approximately 140 meters below the surface.

1005
01:16:06,405 --> 01:16:08,695
Queen mother, I've found her signal.

1006
01:16:08,865 --> 01:16:10,995
It's coming from an underwater cave.

1007
01:16:11,995 --> 01:16:12,995
If she's down there,

1008
01:16:13,075 --> 01:16:14,705
I'm sure I'll encounter resistance.

1009
01:16:15,665 --> 01:16:17,585
How would you like me to proceed?

1010
01:16:18,505 --> 01:16:22,875
Retrieve the Princess by any means necessary.

1011
01:16:23,045 --> 01:16:26,255
I will attempt to draw Namor out.

1012
01:17:01,165 --> 01:17:02,835
You are the first person from the surface

1013
01:17:02,915 --> 01:17:04,425
to come to Talokan.

1014
01:17:05,425 --> 01:17:07,465
Please take this as a token of our gratitude.

1015
01:17:14,635 --> 01:17:17,225
It was made with the plant that saved Talokan.

1016
01:17:20,015 --> 01:17:21,395
You are young, Princess.

1017
01:17:22,275 --> 01:17:25,195
When you age as I do, you realize

1018
01:17:25,355 --> 01:17:28,115
we all lose everyone we love.

1019
01:17:28,275 --> 01:17:29,865
But when I lost my brother,

1020
01:17:30,025 --> 01:17:31,655
it just felt different.

1021
01:17:31,825 --> 01:17:33,495
He suffered in silence.

1022
01:17:34,075 --> 01:17:37,075
When he finally asked me to help him, I couldn't.

1023
01:17:38,165 --> 01:17:39,875
How does that make sense

1024
01:17:40,835 --> 01:17:44,505
that the ancestors would give me gifts and skills

1025
01:17:44,665 --> 01:17:47,425
to help me save my brother, and I couldn't?

1026
01:17:52,385 --> 01:17:54,885
I don't have an answer for that question.

1027
01:17:57,015 --> 01:17:59,555
My ancestors would often say,

1028
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:03,355
"only the most broken people
can be great leaders."

1029
01:18:07,105 --> 01:18:09,275
I admire what you have built here.

1030
01:18:11,575 --> 01:18:14,035
And how you've protected your people.

1031
01:18:14,825 --> 01:18:17,865
But as Princess of Wakanda,

1032
01:18:18,035 --> 01:18:20,495
I will not stand for you killing that young woman.

1033
01:18:22,205 --> 01:18:25,295
My nation will not rest until I'm returned.

1034
01:18:26,715 --> 01:18:28,835
I'm not leaving without her.

1035
01:18:29,585 --> 01:18:33,305
We need to find a peaceful way to resolve this.

1036
01:18:36,975 --> 01:18:38,685
It is no longer about the scientist.

1037
01:18:40,765 --> 01:18:42,395
For centuries, the surface nations

1038
01:18:42,475 --> 01:18:45,275
have conquered and enslaved people like us.

1039
01:18:45,935 --> 01:18:47,395
Over resources.

1040
01:18:48,815 --> 01:18:51,065
Since the day I buried my mother,

1041
01:18:51,235 --> 01:18:52,865
I have prepared my people

1042
01:18:52,945 --> 01:18:55,075
for the time they will come for us.

1043
01:18:55,245 --> 01:18:59,455
And that machine is the sign that the time is now.

1044
01:19:01,325 --> 01:19:06,665
I need to know if Wakanda is an ally or an enemy.

1045
01:19:07,085 --> 01:19:08,965
There is no in-between.

1046
01:19:11,085 --> 01:19:14,805
So you plan to wage war on the entire world,

1047
01:19:15,385 --> 01:19:17,725
and you want Wakanda to help you?

1048
01:19:18,635 --> 01:19:19,805
That's madness.

1049
01:19:19,975 --> 01:19:22,975
There isn't a nation that wouldn't plunder Wakanda

1050
01:19:23,055 --> 01:19:24,605
if given a chance.

1051
01:19:25,935 --> 01:19:27,855
If we make an alliance,

1052
01:19:28,025 --> 01:19:30,735
we can protect each other by striking them first.

1053
01:19:31,275 --> 01:19:35,535
Then, when the threat of these nations has been eliminated,

1054
01:19:35,695 --> 01:19:38,325
the scientist will be returned to Wakanda.

1055
01:19:38,745 --> 01:19:41,535
And if Wakanda does not accept, what then?

1056
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:44,585
The scientist will die.

1057
01:19:45,585 --> 01:19:48,505
And Wakanda will be the first nation to fall.

1058
01:19:48,755 --> 01:19:50,295
An attack on my people?

1059
01:19:50,625 --> 01:19:52,085
Yes.

1060
01:19:52,255 --> 01:19:54,635
And I want you to listen to me.

1061
01:19:54,795 --> 01:19:57,765
Wakanda cannot win a war with Talokan.

1062
01:20:09,605 --> 01:20:11,815
I heard you that night,

1063
01:20:11,905 --> 01:20:13,905
with your mother at the river.

1064
01:20:15,195 --> 01:20:17,945
You said you wanted to burn the world.

1065
01:20:24,125 --> 01:20:25,625
Let us burn it together.

1066
01:20:34,255 --> 01:20:35,485
Queen Ramonda

1067
01:20:35,505 --> 01:20:37,175
won't sell us any vibranium.

1068
01:20:37,925 --> 01:20:39,465
And now they abducted a young woman

1069
01:20:39,555 --> 01:20:40,805
who built the machine.

1070
01:20:40,975 --> 01:20:42,265
Yeah, with all due respect,

1071
01:20:42,345 --> 01:20:43,975
Riri Williams is a child prodigy

1072
01:20:44,055 --> 01:20:46,265
who was running circles around all of her professors.

1073
01:20:46,435 --> 01:20:47,895
The Wakandans were recruiting her

1074
01:20:47,975 --> 01:20:49,315
as part of their outreach program.

1075
01:20:49,475 --> 01:20:50,895
Nothing more. And then,

1076
01:20:51,065 --> 01:20:53,445
you guys send in a SWAT team under cover of night

1077
01:20:53,605 --> 01:20:55,615
to arrest the crown Princess

1078
01:20:55,695 --> 01:20:57,025
of an international superpower.

1079
01:21:00,195 --> 01:21:01,915
The president wants to take offensive action

1080
01:21:01,955 --> 01:21:02,995
against Wakanda.

1081
01:21:04,415 --> 01:21:06,285
What type of offensive action?

1082
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:08,535
Destabilization.

1083
01:21:09,705 --> 01:21:13,045
Well, special officer Ross is our expert.

1084
01:21:13,215 --> 01:21:15,425
So, Ross, what do you think?

1085
01:21:15,585 --> 01:21:17,095
My sources are telling me

1086
01:21:17,175 --> 01:21:18,575
that there's someone else out there.

1087
01:21:19,305 --> 01:21:21,225
- Another nation?
- Could be. I don't know.

1088
01:21:21,305 --> 01:21:22,365
You've gotta give me enough time

1089
01:21:22,385 --> 01:21:23,535
to investigate this properly,

1090
01:21:23,555 --> 01:21:25,685
otherwise we're gonna find ourselves at war

1091
01:21:25,845 --> 01:21:27,685
with a country whose military capacity

1092
01:21:27,765 --> 01:21:29,725
we can't even comprehend.

1093
01:21:31,315 --> 01:21:32,315
Director?

1094
01:21:32,775 --> 01:21:35,025
I think he's the expert.

1095
01:21:35,105 --> 01:21:38,115
I think it would be a mistake to attack Wakanda.

1096
01:21:44,905 --> 01:21:45,915
Yes?

1097
01:21:45,995 --> 01:21:46,995
We have a problem.

1098
01:22:08,555 --> 01:22:10,895
Is my daughter alive?

1099
01:22:11,055 --> 01:22:13,025
The Princess is alive and well.

1100
01:22:13,735 --> 01:22:16,565
She requested to be taken to Talokan.

1101
01:22:16,735 --> 01:22:19,115
She will remain there for the time being.

1102
01:22:22,735 --> 01:22:25,995
What can I offer you in exchange?

1103
01:22:26,405 --> 01:22:27,415
Nothing.

1104
01:22:27,865 --> 01:22:29,575
I beg to differ.

1105
01:22:29,745 --> 01:22:33,415
The Americans are preparing to blame Wakanda

1106
01:22:33,495 --> 01:22:36,045
for your attack on their mining ship.

1107
01:22:36,215 --> 01:22:39,175
Return my daughter and the scientist

1108
01:22:39,335 --> 01:22:42,925
or I will inform them of your existence.

1109
01:22:49,635 --> 01:22:51,765
If you tell the Americans about us,

1110
01:22:53,265 --> 01:22:55,435
if you try to find us,

1111
01:22:56,525 --> 01:23:00,315
or if I discover a single Wakandan ship in the ocean,

1112
01:23:01,115 --> 01:23:02,575
I will kill the Princess.

1113
01:23:04,115 --> 01:23:05,905
I will come to Wakanda

1114
01:23:06,075 --> 01:23:08,035
and iwill kill you.

1115
01:23:17,375 --> 01:23:18,415
So, what happened?

1116
01:23:20,295 --> 01:23:23,295
He wants to go to war with the surface world,

1117
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:25,255
and asked me to help him.

1118
01:23:29,765 --> 01:23:31,185
I need to think.

1119
01:23:32,055 --> 01:23:34,015
We ain't never gettin' out of here.

1120
01:24:07,465 --> 01:24:08,465
Shuri...

1121
01:24:15,605 --> 01:24:16,725
Are you okay?

1122
01:24:17,525 --> 01:24:18,895
Are you okay?

1123
01:24:19,145 --> 01:24:20,425
- Give me your beads!
- Let's go.

1124
01:24:20,565 --> 01:24:21,945
Give me your beads.
I can save her.

1125
01:24:22,025 --> 01:24:23,025
We have to go.

1126
01:24:23,195 --> 01:24:24,375
Shuri, I don't know who this lady is,

1127
01:24:24,405 --> 01:24:25,565
but we need to listen to her.

1128
01:24:25,655 --> 01:24:26,965
Listen, I hit her with a sonic round.

1129
01:24:26,985 --> 01:24:29,245
It is lethal from this distance.
There is no chance.

1130
01:24:29,325 --> 01:24:31,205
You don't understand.
This will mean war.

1131
01:24:31,365 --> 01:24:33,705
- We have to go.
- Wait!

1132
01:25:17,335 --> 01:25:18,335
Did they hurt you?

1133
01:25:18,415 --> 01:25:20,045
No. No.

1134
01:25:21,585 --> 01:25:22,795
Thank you.

1135
01:25:26,295 --> 01:25:27,565
- Griot.
- Yes, my queen.

1136
01:25:27,595 --> 01:25:29,635
Return us to Wakanda at once.

1137
01:28:26,565 --> 01:28:28,975
Princess, it is good to have you back.

1138
01:28:29,525 --> 01:28:31,315
The city has been on edge since you left.

1139
01:28:33,405 --> 01:28:35,985
Fortify the sonic barriers for all waterways.

1140
01:28:36,155 --> 01:28:37,155
Princess?

1141
01:28:38,075 --> 01:28:39,075
Neka.

1142
01:28:41,035 --> 01:28:43,415
Thank the ancestors. Hmm?

1143
01:28:43,745 --> 01:28:46,955
I just wanted to return these.

1144
01:28:48,165 --> 01:28:50,335
No. Keep them.

1145
01:28:50,505 --> 01:28:52,005
Might need them soon.

1146
01:28:52,925 --> 01:28:54,925
Did you get that from down there?

1147
01:28:57,885 --> 01:29:01,265
Is it true you saw an underwater empire?

1148
01:29:02,515 --> 01:29:04,265
- Yes.
- Hmm.

1149
01:29:04,935 --> 01:29:06,515
It is beautiful.

1150
01:29:07,765 --> 01:29:10,395
But these people are dangerous, Aneka.

1151
01:29:10,895 --> 01:29:11,935
Mm.

1152
01:29:30,585 --> 01:29:33,375
So, Miss Riri Williams,

1153
01:29:34,125 --> 01:29:36,295
what do you think of Wakanda?

1154
01:29:36,465 --> 01:29:38,465
The stories just don't do this place justice.

1155
01:29:41,595 --> 01:29:42,635
It's great.

1156
01:29:42,805 --> 01:29:44,555
But I really would like to go home.

1157
01:29:46,015 --> 01:29:47,605
You will need to be patient.

1158
01:29:47,765 --> 01:29:49,815
Can I at least call my mom?

1159
01:29:56,235 --> 01:29:57,715
The Princess has been brought home

1160
01:29:57,735 --> 01:29:59,525
by the war dog Nakia.

1161
01:29:59,695 --> 01:30:01,075
Glory to hanuman.

1162
01:30:01,155 --> 01:30:02,615
Glory to hanuman.

1163
01:30:02,695 --> 01:30:07,245
Mm. The spy saves Wakanda once again.

1164
01:30:07,825 --> 01:30:09,285
The queen will reward her

1165
01:30:09,455 --> 01:30:11,955
with lifetime banishment.
I'm sure of it.

1166
01:30:14,415 --> 01:30:15,875
Okoye.

1167
01:30:21,505 --> 01:30:23,105
After Thanos' attack,

1168
01:30:23,215 --> 01:30:25,345
when you left without saying a word,

1169
01:30:25,975 --> 01:30:27,135
it hurt.

1170
01:30:31,105 --> 01:30:34,525
I regret not being there with all of you.

1171
01:30:36,025 --> 01:30:37,315
It was not easy.

1172
01:30:38,105 --> 01:30:39,105
He was...

1173
01:30:39,775 --> 01:30:43,615
King and Black Panther to everyone.

1174
01:30:44,285 --> 01:30:46,455
But to me...

1175
01:30:52,205 --> 01:30:53,915
He was everything.

1176
01:30:55,795 --> 01:30:57,755
My T'Challa.

1177
01:30:59,085 --> 01:31:02,045
When he was taken away from me, just like that, I...

1178
01:31:02,805 --> 01:31:04,675
I had to step away

1179
01:31:05,595 --> 01:31:07,225
and let myself break.

1180
01:31:09,895 --> 01:31:11,105
I couldn't just...

1181
01:31:12,055 --> 01:31:15,435
Keep going as if nothing had happened, you know.

1182
01:31:16,275 --> 01:31:18,235
Mm-hmm.

1183
01:31:33,245 --> 01:31:34,245
We are under attack.

1184
01:31:42,135 --> 01:31:43,215
Here.

1185
01:31:51,895 --> 01:31:53,615
Are you okay? Are you all right?

1186
01:31:53,645 --> 01:31:55,515
Griot, activate the sunbird.

1187
01:31:55,685 --> 01:31:56,855
Shuri, where are you?

1188
01:31:57,025 --> 01:31:58,485
Making my way to the city right now.

1189
01:31:58,645 --> 01:32:00,105
Stand down! That is an order!

1190
01:32:00,275 --> 01:32:02,565
Mother, I'm with Aneka.
We can provide air support.

1191
01:32:02,735 --> 01:32:04,175
Aneka, do not let her leave the lab.

1192
01:32:04,195 --> 01:32:05,335
Mother, you're...
You're breaking up.

1193
01:32:05,365 --> 01:32:06,425
- We can't hear you.
- Shuri!

1194
01:32:06,445 --> 01:32:07,445
Love you. Bye!

1195
01:32:09,785 --> 01:32:10,985
You just hung up on the queen.

1196
01:32:11,035 --> 01:32:12,035
I just hung up on my mom.

1197
01:32:12,205 --> 01:32:13,785
There's a difference.
Come. Let's go!

1198
01:32:46,025 --> 01:32:48,115
Invaders!

1199
01:32:53,705 --> 01:32:56,915
Mama! Mama!

1200
01:33:05,335 --> 01:33:06,395
Emts are suffering

1201
01:33:06,425 --> 01:33:08,215
a form of sonic hypnosis.

1202
01:33:12,225 --> 01:33:14,055
General, plug your ears.

1203
01:33:14,225 --> 01:33:15,305
Yes, my queen.

1204
01:34:01,725 --> 01:34:03,855
- Can I help?
- Come, quickly.

1205
01:34:14,455 --> 01:34:15,595
Cross your arms...

1206
01:34:21,295 --> 01:34:22,295
Nakia.

1207
01:34:36,685 --> 01:34:37,975
The fish man.

1208
01:35:13,095 --> 01:35:14,095
Phambili!

1209
01:36:26,335 --> 01:36:27,435
Shit, he's too fast.

1210
01:36:27,455 --> 01:36:28,655
He's even faster in the water.

1211
01:36:54,355 --> 01:36:55,925
- Activating system override.
- No.

1212
01:36:55,945 --> 01:36:57,005
Wait! I'll fix it.

1213
01:36:57,025 --> 01:36:58,945
Can't leave you here, Shuri!

1214
01:37:15,425 --> 01:37:16,425
Do you see her?

1215
01:37:16,505 --> 01:37:17,885
Yes. Right there.

1216
01:37:31,395 --> 01:37:33,065
Go, child.

1217
01:37:33,855 --> 01:37:35,405
Wait, what? And leave you here?

1218
01:37:35,485 --> 01:37:36,485
Run!

1219
01:37:51,165 --> 01:37:52,625
Okoye, move now!

1220
01:39:00,365 --> 01:39:01,445
She did this.

1221
01:39:05,495 --> 01:39:06,655
In one week's time,

1222
01:39:06,745 --> 01:39:09,415
I will return with my entire army

1223
01:39:09,575 --> 01:39:12,835
and you will join us against the surface world,

1224
01:39:12,995 --> 01:39:15,955
or I will wash Wakanda from the face of the earth.

1225
01:39:18,925 --> 01:39:19,925
Mother.

1226
01:39:20,385 --> 01:39:22,095
- Keep her back!
- Mother!

1227
01:39:22,425 --> 01:39:25,135
- Mama! Mama!
- Bury your dead.

1228
01:39:25,885 --> 01:39:27,425
Mourn your losses.

1229
01:39:30,765 --> 01:39:32,355
You are queen now.

1230
01:39:32,605 --> 01:39:33,605
Mother!

1231
01:39:38,485 --> 01:39:40,025
Get off of me! Mother!

1232
01:39:40,775 --> 01:39:42,655
Mama!

1233
01:39:49,495 --> 01:39:51,535
Mama!

1234
01:39:51,625 --> 01:39:53,035
Mama!

1235
01:39:53,625 --> 01:39:54,795
Mother!

1236
01:40:02,335 --> 01:40:03,675
Help me!

1237
01:40:03,845 --> 01:40:05,135
Mama!

1238
01:40:12,645 --> 01:40:14,765
Mama!

1239
01:40:55,475 --> 01:41:00,645
Jabariland offers you their comfort for your loss.

1240
01:41:07,275 --> 01:41:08,945
You must mourn her

1241
01:41:09,115 --> 01:41:13,035
in accordance to the rituals of your ancestors.

1242
01:41:14,995 --> 01:41:16,835
Do not bury yourself in your technology.

1243
01:41:16,995 --> 01:41:18,245
Why are you here?

1244
01:41:20,125 --> 01:41:21,835
I promised your brother

1245
01:41:22,005 --> 01:41:24,295
that I would provide you with counsel

1246
01:41:24,465 --> 01:41:25,885
and protection.

1247
01:41:28,345 --> 01:41:30,555
But I am in need of your advice today.

1248
01:41:34,385 --> 01:41:36,145
Your tribal elders have approached me

1249
01:41:36,225 --> 01:41:38,015
with a proposition.

1250
01:41:39,435 --> 01:41:42,685
They wish to evacuate the city and set up camp

1251
01:41:42,855 --> 01:41:44,355
in Jabariland.

1252
01:41:44,525 --> 01:41:47,695
So, now you are keen to hear from a child

1253
01:41:48,365 --> 01:41:50,035
who scoffs at tradition?

1254
01:41:51,035 --> 01:41:52,075
Mm.

1255
01:41:54,245 --> 01:41:55,245
The world...

1256
01:41:57,165 --> 01:41:59,835
The world has taken too much from you

1257
01:42:00,585 --> 01:42:03,835
for you to still be considered a child.

1258
01:42:06,965 --> 01:42:08,885
It is in my people's interest to know

1259
01:42:08,965 --> 01:42:11,425
which way your mind is leaning.

1260
01:42:13,305 --> 01:42:15,015
The elders are desperate.

1261
01:42:16,645 --> 01:42:18,555
The city is vulnerable.

1262
01:42:20,765 --> 01:42:22,935
If you are to provide for them,

1263
01:42:24,065 --> 01:42:26,315
they will be in great debt to you.

1264
01:42:28,405 --> 01:42:30,115
And what of your heart?

1265
01:42:33,655 --> 01:42:35,655
Which way is your heart leaning?

1266
01:42:37,535 --> 01:42:40,495
I just buried the last person who truly knew me.

1267
01:42:44,005 --> 01:42:45,665
My heart was buried with her.

1268
01:43:21,785 --> 01:43:23,665
Oh, man.

1269
01:43:24,545 --> 01:43:26,455
Yeah, your olive oil's about to go bad.

1270
01:43:26,625 --> 01:43:27,775
What... what are you doing here?

1271
01:43:27,795 --> 01:43:30,465
I'm hungry. And...

1272
01:43:30,885 --> 01:43:32,885
Tragedy strikes the international community.

1273
01:43:32,965 --> 01:43:34,135
Sources can now confirm

1274
01:43:34,215 --> 01:43:37,175
that Queen Ramonda, Daughter of Lumumba, has died.

1275
01:43:37,805 --> 01:43:39,385
Western allies say that civil conflict

1276
01:43:39,475 --> 01:43:41,515
was the likely cause of the queen's...

1277
01:43:45,435 --> 01:43:46,775
You have any comment?

1278
01:43:48,945 --> 01:43:52,115
I wonder what else your friends are keeping from you.

1279
01:43:52,315 --> 01:43:53,945
What are you talking about?

1280
01:43:54,115 --> 01:43:57,615
I have no unsanctioned contact
with the Kingdom of Wakanda.

1281
01:44:00,035 --> 01:44:02,205
What about the beads?

1282
01:44:02,495 --> 01:44:04,495
What?

1283
01:44:04,665 --> 01:44:05,665
The beads.

1284
01:44:05,835 --> 01:44:06,955
I had them bugged

1285
01:44:07,125 --> 01:44:08,795
before you ever even got there.

1286
01:44:08,965 --> 01:44:12,795
I've been privy to every conversation you've had,

1287
01:44:12,885 --> 01:44:15,555
including that treasonous call with the queen.

1288
01:44:15,715 --> 01:44:17,095
May she rest in peace.

1289
01:44:17,515 --> 01:44:18,805
But it's good.

1290
01:44:18,975 --> 01:44:20,015
Well, for us.

1291
01:44:20,185 --> 01:44:22,895
All right. You know what?
The Wakandans saved my life.

1292
01:44:23,395 --> 01:44:25,015
- They're a good people.
- Mm-hmm.

1293
01:44:25,105 --> 01:44:27,145
You ever thought for a second

1294
01:44:27,315 --> 01:44:28,935
what they could be doing?

1295
01:44:29,105 --> 01:44:30,525
Ever thought what we would be doing

1296
01:44:30,605 --> 01:44:33,815
if the us was the only country in the world with vibranium?

1297
01:44:34,065 --> 01:44:38,365
Oh, I actually dream about that.

1298
01:44:41,205 --> 01:44:42,865
Val. Val, please.

1299
01:44:43,245 --> 01:44:44,875
It's director de fontaine.

1300
01:44:47,745 --> 01:44:50,915
Your mother protected me like I was one of her own.

1301
01:44:52,215 --> 01:44:54,675
The least that I could do is try to return the favor.

1302
01:44:57,005 --> 01:44:59,385
We need to find a way to weaken Namor.

1303
01:44:59,555 --> 01:45:01,725
Even weakened, he's still gonna be a problem.

1304
01:45:01,885 --> 01:45:05,305
The Black Panther has never failed to protect Wakanda.

1305
01:45:06,055 --> 01:45:08,065
I thought the Black Panther was gone.

1306
01:45:17,775 --> 01:45:19,115
My brother is dead.

1307
01:45:20,865 --> 01:45:23,455
But it doesn't mean the Black Panther is gone.

1308
01:45:41,215 --> 01:45:42,765
Griot?

1309
01:45:42,925 --> 01:45:45,555
Let's start by running a comparative analysis

1310
01:45:45,725 --> 01:45:47,515
between our attempts at creating

1311
01:45:47,605 --> 01:45:49,315
a synthetic heart-shaped herb...

1312
01:45:52,025 --> 01:45:53,985
And the fibers from this bracelet.

1313
01:45:54,565 --> 01:45:55,855
Yes, Princess.

1314
01:45:59,155 --> 01:46:01,905
Since this was grown from vibranium-rich soil,

1315
01:46:03,155 --> 01:46:05,415
they may share some base-level similarities

1316
01:46:05,495 --> 01:46:06,615
that we can exploit.

1317
01:46:06,785 --> 01:46:08,075
As you wish, Princess.

1318
01:46:12,375 --> 01:46:14,795
Please upload my brother's DNA also.

1319
01:46:14,965 --> 01:46:16,085
Uploading now.

1320
01:46:32,685 --> 01:46:34,815
Who do I turn to

1321
01:46:35,445 --> 01:46:37,065
when I need saving

1322
01:46:37,735 --> 01:46:39,905
'cause you move mountain

1323
01:46:40,485 --> 01:46:42,325
I can't do the same

1324
01:46:43,155 --> 01:46:44,655
and did you think about

1325
01:46:46,365 --> 01:46:47,575
when you left us

1326
01:46:47,665 --> 01:46:48,995
why doesn't he look like them?

1327
01:46:49,165 --> 01:46:51,375
His physiology is completely different.

1328
01:46:51,535 --> 01:46:54,205
None of them fly or have pointed ears like him.

1329
01:46:54,705 --> 01:46:55,765
The women that were guarding us,

1330
01:46:55,795 --> 01:46:56,855
they had water over their mouths

1331
01:46:56,875 --> 01:46:58,585
and on their necks.

1332
01:46:58,675 --> 01:46:59,675
He didn't have that.

1333
01:46:59,835 --> 01:47:02,255
Several organisms don't need gills

1334
01:47:02,345 --> 01:47:05,265
to extract oxygen from the water, so...

1335
01:47:05,425 --> 01:47:06,975
It's like a jellyfish.

1336
01:47:07,135 --> 01:47:10,935
He just absorbs the oxygen from his skin.

1337
01:47:12,265 --> 01:47:13,265
It's a process called

1338
01:47:13,355 --> 01:47:14,565
- diffusion.
- Diffusion.

1339
01:47:16,855 --> 01:47:21,365
Memories, oh, carry me go

1340
01:47:22,195 --> 01:47:25,825
carry me go, oh, nowhere

1341
01:47:26,285 --> 01:47:29,825
sick and tired of it all take me far-away

1342
01:47:29,915 --> 01:47:32,205
mr dj gbemi traba ye

1343
01:47:32,285 --> 01:47:34,955
now I no fit trust anybody

1344
01:47:35,045 --> 01:47:36,795
na e make I no fit shout

1345
01:47:36,875 --> 01:47:38,795
my body Don dey tire eh

1346
01:47:38,875 --> 01:47:41,675
every day that passes without selecting the ruler

1347
01:47:41,835 --> 01:47:43,215
is a day wasted.

1348
01:47:43,385 --> 01:47:44,965
We must deal with Namor

1349
01:47:45,055 --> 01:47:46,805
before he brings his warriors back here.

1350
01:47:46,975 --> 01:47:49,635
And how are we to deal with a man with that much power?

1351
01:47:50,515 --> 01:47:52,315
In that attack, before he took out your plane,

1352
01:47:52,395 --> 01:47:53,645
he jumped back into the water.

1353
01:47:53,815 --> 01:47:55,565
What if that's what makes him strong?

1354
01:47:55,725 --> 01:47:57,645
He's breathing air and getting oxygen

1355
01:47:57,735 --> 01:47:59,275
from the water on his skin.

1356
01:47:59,445 --> 01:48:01,485
If we could find a way to dry his ass out,

1357
01:48:01,565 --> 01:48:02,695
he won't be as strong.

1358
01:48:03,025 --> 01:48:04,275
Yo, that's it.

1359
01:48:04,365 --> 01:48:07,575
Griot. We need to convert the royal Talon fighter

1360
01:48:07,655 --> 01:48:09,205
into a pervaporation chamber.

1361
01:48:09,365 --> 01:48:10,455
Is that even possible?

1362
01:48:10,615 --> 01:48:11,785
Yes.

1363
01:48:13,285 --> 01:48:15,205
You're going to help us trap him.

1364
01:48:16,045 --> 01:48:18,045
Please show miss Williams where she's working.

1365
01:48:18,205 --> 01:48:19,755
Right this way.

1366
01:48:23,595 --> 01:48:24,595
How old were you

1367
01:48:24,675 --> 01:48:26,095
when you built your first machine?

1368
01:48:26,255 --> 01:48:27,345
Three.

1369
01:48:27,515 --> 01:48:30,975
My stepdad was a car mechanic.
He wanted to build airplanes.

1370
01:48:31,135 --> 01:48:33,605
He gave me these tools and let me just work it out.

1371
01:48:37,525 --> 01:48:39,815
So who taught you how to do all that you do?

1372
01:48:40,145 --> 01:48:41,395
My big brother.

1373
01:48:44,445 --> 01:48:47,785
I was the tip of the spear of Wakanda's army.

1374
01:48:47,945 --> 01:48:50,365
This is not me.

1375
01:48:50,865 --> 01:48:53,035
Besides, I'm a civilian now.

1376
01:48:54,125 --> 01:48:55,495
I turned in my weapon.

1377
01:48:56,125 --> 01:48:57,795
I built you a new spear as well.

1378
01:48:59,665 --> 01:49:00,665
A new one?

1379
01:49:00,835 --> 01:49:01,875
Yes.

1380
01:49:03,215 --> 01:49:05,595
What is this contraption's name anyway?

1381
01:49:05,755 --> 01:49:07,215
The midnight angel.

1382
01:49:07,385 --> 01:49:08,845
Midnight angel?

1383
01:49:11,765 --> 01:49:13,975
This will even the odds against them.

1384
01:49:14,145 --> 01:49:16,605
Sister, I need you to be ready when I call you.

1385
01:49:18,435 --> 01:49:19,645
Please.

1386
01:49:19,725 --> 01:49:22,275
My body Don dey tire eh

1387
01:49:22,355 --> 01:49:24,155
make me Mara eh

1388
01:49:24,235 --> 01:49:25,445
Shuri.

1389
01:49:26,115 --> 01:49:27,275
Yes.

1390
01:49:28,905 --> 01:49:30,495
How many of these did you make?

1391
01:49:32,615 --> 01:49:34,575
I looked for you at the Jabari outpost.

1392
01:49:34,745 --> 01:49:36,415
I won't be forced out of my home.

1393
01:49:36,575 --> 01:49:39,125
You have such a rebellious spirit.

1394
01:49:39,205 --> 01:49:40,665
Why did you join the dora?

1395
01:49:41,705 --> 01:49:42,875
Why do you care?

1396
01:49:43,165 --> 01:49:45,925
As far as I can see na the memories

1397
01:49:46,005 --> 01:49:48,545
wey dey carry me from reality

1398
01:49:48,635 --> 01:49:50,055
e no require visa

1399
01:49:50,135 --> 01:49:52,635
I still have a lot of fight left in me.

1400
01:49:53,135 --> 01:49:56,265
Tell me, Aneka, daughter of kyana,

1401
01:49:56,935 --> 01:49:59,145
do you still have some fight left in you?

1402
01:49:59,315 --> 01:50:01,725
What do you have in mind?

1403
01:50:02,435 --> 01:50:05,275
My body Don dey tire eh

1404
01:50:13,655 --> 01:50:15,705
My body Don dey tire eh

1405
01:50:15,785 --> 01:50:18,285
make me Mara eh

1406
01:50:18,375 --> 01:50:20,875
when my whole world is set on fire

1407
01:50:20,955 --> 01:50:23,755
don't leave me alone

1408
01:50:26,375 --> 01:50:27,385
Griot,

1409
01:50:28,925 --> 01:50:30,385
what's the confidence rate?

1410
01:50:31,005 --> 01:50:33,305
98.7%, Princess.

1411
01:50:33,675 --> 01:50:36,345
Would you like me to print the heart-shaped herb?

1412
01:50:43,645 --> 01:50:45,945
Thought you'd be back in Haiti by now.

1413
01:50:47,065 --> 01:50:48,605
I'm still Wakandan, you know.

1414
01:50:54,945 --> 01:50:57,915
This is what you've been up to.

1415
01:50:58,705 --> 01:50:59,875
Yes.

1416
01:51:00,035 --> 01:51:01,955
What you have here, now,

1417
01:51:03,205 --> 01:51:07,425
is a chance to restore Wakanda's protector.

1418
01:51:07,505 --> 01:51:12,925
It would be the greatest gift

1419
01:51:13,385 --> 01:51:15,725
since bashenga's discovery.

1420
01:51:20,855 --> 01:51:23,105
We'll soon find out. Come.

1421
01:51:26,235 --> 01:51:27,695
- Griot?
- Yes, Princess.

1422
01:51:27,775 --> 01:51:28,855
Print it.

1423
01:51:33,025 --> 01:51:34,735
How will we know if it works?

1424
01:51:35,535 --> 01:51:36,785
If it glows.

1425
01:51:51,835 --> 01:51:52,985
I mean, shouldn't we be

1426
01:51:53,005 --> 01:51:54,305
burning incense or something?

1427
01:51:54,925 --> 01:51:56,015
Only bast knows

1428
01:51:56,095 --> 01:51:58,095
how the ancestors will make it to this lab.

1429
01:52:08,435 --> 01:52:10,275
Are you sure you don't want me to Bury you?

1430
01:52:12,025 --> 01:52:14,075
Need you to have access to my chest,

1431
01:52:14,235 --> 01:52:16,285
just in case I go through cardiac arrest.

1432
01:52:16,865 --> 01:52:18,405
"Cardiac arrest"?

1433
01:52:19,495 --> 01:52:20,535
She's joking,

1434
01:52:21,075 --> 01:52:22,325
right?

1435
01:52:23,495 --> 01:52:25,335
Right?

1436
01:52:30,295 --> 01:52:34,135
Allow this heart-shaped herb

1437
01:52:34,505 --> 01:52:37,555
to give you the strength of the Black Panther

1438
01:52:37,965 --> 01:52:40,385
and take you to the ancestral plane.

1439
01:53:59,675 --> 01:54:00,675
Mother?

1440
01:54:14,025 --> 01:54:15,275
N'Jadaka.

1441
01:54:15,855 --> 01:54:17,025
Lil' cousin.

1442
01:54:17,405 --> 01:54:18,405
How?

1443
01:54:18,485 --> 01:54:21,325
How is never as important as why, right?

1444
01:54:23,115 --> 01:54:24,365
You chose me.

1445
01:54:24,535 --> 01:54:27,415
Impossible.
I would never choose you.

1446
01:54:27,575 --> 01:54:29,245
Why did you take the herb?

1447
01:54:30,245 --> 01:54:32,205
- To see my family.
- No, that's bullshit.

1448
01:54:33,165 --> 01:54:35,085
You didn't believe the ancestral plane was real,

1449
01:54:35,165 --> 01:54:36,175
did you?

1450
01:54:41,055 --> 01:54:42,305
So, why did you take it, then?

1451
01:54:44,015 --> 01:54:45,385
You don't have to lie to me.

1452
01:54:46,225 --> 01:54:47,725
So I can be strong.

1453
01:54:48,095 --> 01:54:49,605
Strong to do what?

1454
01:54:52,475 --> 01:54:53,475
See?

1455
01:54:55,025 --> 01:54:56,985
We're more alike than you think.

1456
01:54:58,905 --> 01:55:00,865
I took it to avenge my ancestors too.

1457
01:55:01,025 --> 01:55:02,195
I'm nothing like you.

1458
01:55:03,655 --> 01:55:05,405
You took it for yourself,

1459
01:55:05,575 --> 01:55:07,115
then destroyed the rest.

1460
01:55:08,615 --> 01:55:09,825
Unworthy king,

1461
01:55:10,665 --> 01:55:12,165
afraid of being replaced.

1462
01:55:13,245 --> 01:55:14,255
Just a coward.

1463
01:55:15,505 --> 01:55:16,545
I had the courage to do

1464
01:55:16,625 --> 01:55:18,175
what was necessary to change Wakanda.

1465
01:55:19,585 --> 01:55:21,095
How many people like your scientist

1466
01:55:21,175 --> 01:55:23,555
did Wakanda protect before I took the throne?

1467
01:55:24,595 --> 01:55:25,595
Cowards.

1468
01:55:25,765 --> 01:55:28,015
That was the panthers that came before me,

1469
01:55:29,095 --> 01:55:30,095
and before T'Challa.

1470
01:55:30,185 --> 01:55:32,015
Don't mention my brother.

1471
01:55:32,355 --> 01:55:34,025
You're the reason why he's dead.

1472
01:55:34,525 --> 01:55:37,775
You burnt the herb, left us with no protector.

1473
01:55:37,945 --> 01:55:40,195
Then Namor struck and killed my mother.

1474
01:55:40,355 --> 01:55:42,195
Their blood is on your hands.

1475
01:55:43,365 --> 01:55:44,695
That ain't on me.

1476
01:55:45,235 --> 01:55:46,615
And don't you dare

1477
01:55:46,785 --> 01:55:48,615
take that away from your mother.

1478
01:55:48,785 --> 01:55:50,365
She sacrificed her life to protect

1479
01:55:50,455 --> 01:55:52,285
a young girl from the lost tribe.

1480
01:55:53,665 --> 01:55:56,335
Your father, he was a hypocrite.

1481
01:55:57,835 --> 01:55:59,585
He would've killed that girl.

1482
01:56:00,295 --> 01:56:02,215
Shit, he killed his own brother.

1483
01:56:03,795 --> 01:56:06,465
T'Challa was too noble.

1484
01:56:08,635 --> 01:56:10,975
He let the man who murdered your father live.

1485
01:56:13,105 --> 01:56:14,765
And here you stand.

1486
01:56:20,445 --> 01:56:22,565
Are you gonna be noble like your brother

1487
01:56:22,735 --> 01:56:24,825
or take care of business...

1488
01:56:25,525 --> 01:56:26,655
Like me?

1489
01:56:29,495 --> 01:56:30,495
Are you okay?

1490
01:56:36,375 --> 01:56:37,535
Who did you see?

1491
01:56:42,965 --> 01:56:43,965
No one.

1492
01:56:48,845 --> 01:56:50,265
I failed.

1493
01:56:50,425 --> 01:56:52,555
- It didn't work.
- Hey, Shuri.

1494
01:56:55,685 --> 01:56:58,065
- They abandoned me.
- They would never do that.

1495
01:56:58,145 --> 01:56:59,685
I did everything I was supposed to do.

1496
01:56:59,775 --> 01:57:01,605
- I re-created the herb.
- Okay.

1497
01:57:01,695 --> 01:57:03,735
I just did your stupid ritual, and for what?

1498
01:57:03,905 --> 01:57:05,445
- Relax.
- Why didn't they come for me?

1499
01:57:05,525 --> 01:57:06,655
Just relax.

1500
01:57:13,745 --> 01:57:15,035
Shit.

1501
01:57:19,375 --> 01:57:20,705
Can I get some of that too?

1502
01:57:28,135 --> 01:57:29,175
I think...

1503
01:57:30,715 --> 01:57:32,175
You're going to need a suit.

1504
01:58:03,795 --> 01:58:05,855
There are more people coming from the city.

1505
01:58:05,885 --> 01:58:07,505
They need more space.

1506
01:58:07,675 --> 01:58:08,675
So what?

1507
01:58:09,555 --> 01:58:11,805
You are visitors.

1508
01:58:11,965 --> 01:58:15,185
It is a wonder how anything gets done with you people.

1509
01:58:40,335 --> 01:58:42,625
The Princess!

1510
01:59:16,155 --> 01:59:17,455
She has done it!

1511
01:59:18,165 --> 01:59:21,165
The Black Panther lives!

1512
01:59:39,015 --> 01:59:41,435
Namor believes Wakanda is on her knees.

1513
01:59:43,895 --> 01:59:45,355
Our queen murdered.

1514
01:59:47,855 --> 01:59:49,405
Our capital destroyed.

1515
01:59:51,065 --> 01:59:52,905
He believes we have no protector.

1516
01:59:54,905 --> 01:59:55,905
But now...

1517
01:59:57,705 --> 01:59:59,705
Now is our time to strike.

1518
01:59:59,865 --> 02:00:03,455
How, when we don't even know how to find him?

1519
02:00:04,035 --> 02:00:05,745
We'll bring Namor to us.

1520
02:00:05,915 --> 02:00:07,455
- Here, again?
- No.

1521
02:00:07,625 --> 02:00:09,965
A distant location at sea.

1522
02:00:10,125 --> 02:00:11,545
All right.

1523
02:00:11,635 --> 02:00:13,095
Let's say this does work.

1524
02:00:14,385 --> 02:00:17,135
Hmm.
Assuming we can kill this man

1525
02:00:17,305 --> 02:00:20,345
who can fly and is potentially as strong as the hulk...

1526
02:00:23,105 --> 02:00:25,515
Is murdering him the right solution?

1527
02:00:25,975 --> 02:00:27,935
You were calling for his head

1528
02:00:28,105 --> 02:00:30,445
when his only crime was intimidation.

1529
02:00:30,605 --> 02:00:32,405
What has changed, Lord M'Baku?

1530
02:00:32,565 --> 02:00:33,775
His soldiers

1531
02:00:33,945 --> 02:00:35,655
did not call him general or king.

1532
02:00:35,735 --> 02:00:38,405
They called him Kukulkan.

1533
02:00:38,575 --> 02:00:39,785
What is that?

1534
02:00:39,955 --> 02:00:42,075
The feather serpent god.

1535
02:00:42,665 --> 02:00:43,665
What?

1536
02:00:43,745 --> 02:00:45,785
Do you think because we are living in the mountains,

1537
02:00:45,915 --> 02:00:47,795
we do not have access to books?

1538
02:00:48,045 --> 02:00:49,545
Elders,

1539
02:00:49,965 --> 02:00:51,335
with your permission,

1540
02:00:51,505 --> 02:00:55,215
I would like to talk with Lord M'Baku alone.

1541
02:01:05,355 --> 02:01:06,685
Namor's not finished.

1542
02:01:08,105 --> 02:01:11,195
He promised to destroy the surface world.

1543
02:01:11,355 --> 02:01:13,695
Now is our opportunity to take him.

1544
02:01:13,855 --> 02:01:16,115
- What are you afraid of?
- War.

1545
02:01:16,525 --> 02:01:19,865
If Namor is indeed a god to his people,

1546
02:01:20,035 --> 02:01:22,655
killing him will risk eternal war.

1547
02:01:22,745 --> 02:01:23,915
And so what?

1548
02:01:24,455 --> 02:01:26,785
Was my mother's life not worth eternal war?

1549
02:01:26,955 --> 02:01:28,335
Of course it was.

1550
02:01:29,335 --> 02:01:33,425
Of course she was.

1551
02:01:35,425 --> 02:01:38,635
But it is not what she would have wanted for you.

1552
02:01:44,095 --> 02:01:45,805
And it is not what I want...

1553
02:01:48,435 --> 02:01:50,185
For my people.

1554
02:02:00,535 --> 02:02:03,575
You speak of my mother as if she's still here.

1555
02:02:04,495 --> 02:02:06,495
Of what she would've wanted for me.

1556
02:02:07,575 --> 02:02:09,875
Her hopes and her dreams.

1557
02:02:13,045 --> 02:02:14,545
But she's dead.

1558
02:02:15,585 --> 02:02:16,585
She's gone!

1559
02:02:18,295 --> 02:02:22,175
Namor drowned her, right in front of me!

1560
02:02:23,595 --> 02:02:24,885
So, her dreams,

1561
02:02:25,055 --> 02:02:28,145
her goals, her hopes for me...

1562
02:02:31,475 --> 02:02:32,725
It doesn't exist.

1563
02:02:35,445 --> 02:02:36,985
It doesn't matter anymore.

1564
02:02:39,065 --> 02:02:41,945
What matters is what I want,

1565
02:02:42,115 --> 02:02:44,825
and what I want is Namor dead!

1566
02:02:48,825 --> 02:02:50,495
And you're going to help me get it.

1567
02:03:06,765 --> 02:03:08,395
We leave in the morning.

1568
02:03:34,205 --> 02:03:35,205
Hi.

1569
02:03:35,375 --> 02:03:36,375
Good morning.

1570
02:03:39,005 --> 02:03:40,215
If we survive this,

1571
02:03:41,885 --> 02:03:45,095
I want you to know you have a home with me in Haiti.

1572
02:03:47,935 --> 02:03:50,265
Here. Take my hands.

1573
02:03:58,945 --> 02:04:01,445
Shuri, I want you to be honest with me.

1574
02:04:01,615 --> 02:04:04,655
Who did you see when you took the herb?

1575
02:04:09,825 --> 02:04:11,535
If you go to war for vengeance,

1576
02:04:11,625 --> 02:04:14,125
it will not fill the hole left from her loss.

1577
02:04:14,705 --> 02:04:16,585
It will only grow larger,

1578
02:04:16,755 --> 02:04:18,215
and it will consume you.

1579
02:04:20,465 --> 02:04:21,835
It already has.

1580
02:05:51,215 --> 02:05:52,515
For the queen.

1581
02:06:26,005 --> 02:06:27,425
Phambili!

1582
02:07:06,585 --> 02:07:08,465
Riri, how's it going up there?

1583
02:07:08,835 --> 02:07:10,115
Hey, Mr. Griot.

1584
02:07:10,175 --> 02:07:11,775
I could really use that backup right now.

1585
02:07:11,805 --> 02:07:13,765
I thought you'd never ask.

1586
02:07:19,555 --> 02:07:20,555
Shit.

1587
02:07:25,025 --> 02:07:26,395
Shit, he's fast.

1588
02:07:27,065 --> 02:07:28,275
But I'm faster.

1589
02:07:33,905 --> 02:07:35,495
Whoo!

1590
02:07:48,255 --> 02:07:49,295
I got you.

1591
02:07:55,635 --> 02:07:56,975
It's on you now, Shuri.

1592
02:08:06,145 --> 02:08:07,525
- Princess.
- No.

1593
02:08:08,025 --> 02:08:11,525
I am the Black Panther, and I'm here for retribution!

1594
02:08:12,195 --> 02:08:15,195
Pervaporation cells activated.

1595
02:08:24,625 --> 02:08:25,625
What's wrong?

1596
02:08:26,375 --> 02:08:27,665
You need a glass of water?

1597
02:08:31,675 --> 02:08:33,385
- Yo, we got him.
- Good!

1598
02:08:33,465 --> 02:08:34,755
Namor has been captured.

1599
02:08:40,885 --> 02:08:42,395
Back to Wakanda!

1600
02:08:48,105 --> 02:08:49,105
Move out!

1601
02:09:14,175 --> 02:09:16,095
What is going on?

1602
02:09:16,175 --> 02:09:18,055
The sonic emitter has been destroyed.

1603
02:09:40,285 --> 02:09:41,785
That can't be good.

1604
02:10:13,895 --> 02:10:16,065
Panther, the sea leopard has lost power,

1605
02:10:16,155 --> 02:10:18,195
and they are experiencing significant casualties.

1606
02:10:19,735 --> 02:10:20,735
Okoye.

1607
02:10:20,905 --> 02:10:22,155
Panther.

1608
02:10:22,285 --> 02:10:23,285
Phambili!

1609
02:10:23,365 --> 02:10:24,365
Aneka.

1610
02:10:25,615 --> 02:10:26,625
O koye!

1611
02:10:26,705 --> 02:10:28,075
It is time.

1612
02:10:32,665 --> 02:10:34,185
Phambili!

1613
02:10:38,965 --> 02:10:40,005
For Wakanda!

1614
02:10:40,715 --> 02:10:41,925
Wakanda!

1615
02:10:50,265 --> 02:10:51,815
Griot, what's the damage?

1616
02:10:51,895 --> 02:10:52,895
Catastrophic.

1617
02:10:52,975 --> 02:10:54,355
His spear is made of raw vibranium.

1618
02:10:54,435 --> 02:10:55,875
The ship could explode at any second.

1619
02:10:55,945 --> 02:10:56,945
Get us to the desert.

1620
02:11:15,755 --> 02:11:17,045
No!

1621
02:12:14,475 --> 02:12:15,535
I got you, sis.

1622
02:12:15,565 --> 02:12:16,645
Hold on.

1623
02:14:00,835 --> 02:14:02,045
Get offme!

1624
02:14:14,095 --> 02:14:15,305
All right, come here.

1625
02:14:45,925 --> 02:14:47,725
May the ancestors save us

1626
02:14:47,755 --> 02:14:49,385
if the Princess does not hurry.

1627
02:14:49,465 --> 02:14:51,175
We may be going to join them.

1628
02:14:52,095 --> 02:14:53,175
If so, hey,

1629
02:14:53,345 --> 02:14:55,595
let us take as many of them with us as we can.

1630
02:15:25,715 --> 02:15:27,125
It could've been different.

1631
02:15:49,815 --> 02:15:51,175
Are you gonna be noble

1632
02:15:51,195 --> 02:15:52,195
like your brother

1633
02:15:52,275 --> 02:15:53,615
or take care of business

1634
02:15:53,785 --> 02:15:54,825
like me?

1635
02:15:54,985 --> 02:15:56,535
I'm not my brother.

1636
02:15:57,955 --> 02:15:59,955
Namorwill beg me for mercy

1637
02:16:00,625 --> 02:16:03,165
as I stand and watch as he dies.

1638
02:16:46,625 --> 02:16:48,585
Wakanda forever!

1639
02:18:36,985 --> 02:18:38,485
Shuri.

1640
02:18:40,025 --> 02:18:41,035
Mama.

1641
02:18:43,995 --> 02:18:45,285
Show him

1642
02:18:45,655 --> 02:18:47,205
who you are.

1643
02:18:54,045 --> 02:18:55,045
Yield,

1644
02:18:56,255 --> 02:18:58,585
and Wakanda will protect your oceans.

1645
02:18:58,755 --> 02:19:01,005
We will protect your secrets.

1646
02:19:01,175 --> 02:19:02,175
Yield,

1647
02:19:03,425 --> 02:19:05,135
and your people will live.

1648
02:19:09,225 --> 02:19:11,565
Vengeance has consumed us.

1649
02:19:12,015 --> 02:19:14,645
We cannot let it consume our people.

1650
02:20:10,665 --> 02:20:12,535
Wakanda forever!

1651
02:20:12,995 --> 02:20:14,585
Wakanda forever!

1652
02:20:38,815 --> 02:20:40,445
Oou le le oou le le oou le le

1653
02:20:43,815 --> 02:20:46,035
oou le le -

1654
02:20:49,995 --> 02:20:52,625
Oou le le oou le le oou le le

1655
02:20:52,705 --> 02:20:57,125
oou oou le le oou le le oou le oou le

1656
02:20:57,205 --> 02:20:58,875
well, I pray that the universe

1657
02:20:58,965 --> 02:21:00,465
thank you, my love.

1658
02:21:02,175 --> 02:21:04,845
Gives you way more than you deserve

1659
02:21:06,925 --> 02:21:09,515
when the tears fall like shooting stars

1660
02:21:09,925 --> 02:21:11,765
remember who you are

1661
02:21:12,475 --> 02:21:16,315
just look up to the sky you'll see

1662
02:21:16,395 --> 02:21:19,185
well, I pray that the universe

1663
02:21:21,355 --> 02:21:24,195
gives you way more than you deserve

1664
02:21:24,275 --> 02:21:25,445
Yo.

1665
02:21:28,945 --> 02:21:31,075
All set to head home?

1666
02:21:31,155 --> 02:21:32,305
As long as you're sure the police

1667
02:21:32,325 --> 02:21:33,845
won't be waiting for me at the airport.

1668
02:21:33,955 --> 02:21:35,575
Don't worry.
Took care of that.

1669
02:21:35,745 --> 02:21:37,035
But you might want to slow down

1670
02:21:37,125 --> 02:21:39,375
on your homework-for-hire business.

1671
02:21:39,455 --> 02:21:41,835
Get caught slipping, I can't help you with that.

1672
02:21:43,125 --> 02:21:45,105
They said you wanted to talk to me about something?

1673
02:21:45,135 --> 02:21:46,135
Yes.

1674
02:21:46,465 --> 02:21:49,675
Your suit. It's a great design,

1675
02:21:50,215 --> 02:21:51,495
but can't let you leave with it.

1676
02:21:51,635 --> 02:21:52,845
It's all good.

1677
02:21:52,935 --> 02:21:54,225
Figured the least I could do

1678
02:21:54,305 --> 02:21:55,975
is help Wakanda clean up my mess.

1679
02:21:57,225 --> 02:21:58,725
I have one more thing to show you.

1680
02:21:59,145 --> 02:22:00,145
Come.

1681
02:22:04,155 --> 02:22:07,235
Took me a while to find all the parts from the river,

1682
02:22:07,405 --> 02:22:08,775
but it was worth it.

1683
02:22:09,445 --> 02:22:10,445
How did you...

1684
02:22:11,785 --> 02:22:13,325
It's my dad's car.

1685
02:22:14,575 --> 02:22:16,285
We used to work on it before...

1686
02:22:16,375 --> 02:22:18,955
Oou le le oou le le oou le le

1687
02:22:19,045 --> 02:22:21,125
I'm coming back for you

1688
02:22:22,255 --> 02:22:24,125
- you sure this is her?
- Every part.

1689
02:22:24,295 --> 02:22:25,755
Have it shipped to Boston.

1690
02:22:25,925 --> 02:22:27,215
Be there before you arrive.

1691
02:22:32,765 --> 02:22:33,765
Bring it in, man.

1692
02:22:37,355 --> 02:22:41,645
Panther, miss Williams' transport has arrived.

1693
02:22:42,275 --> 02:22:43,815
Look after yourself.

1694
02:22:44,145 --> 02:22:46,565
Sure you're not trying to slide to Chicago?

1695
02:22:46,735 --> 02:22:47,815
Catch a bulls game?

1696
02:22:49,075 --> 02:22:50,615
Sounds fun,

1697
02:22:50,695 --> 02:22:53,535
but I have something I need to take care of.

1698
02:23:18,265 --> 02:23:20,725
And now I present to you

1699
02:23:20,895 --> 02:23:22,065
Princess Shuri,

1700
02:23:22,225 --> 02:23:23,525
the Black Panther!

1701
02:23:41,995 --> 02:23:44,835
The Black Panther sends her regards,

1702
02:23:45,625 --> 02:23:47,625
but she will not be joining us today.

1703
02:23:48,755 --> 02:23:50,715
I, M'Baku,

1704
02:23:50,885 --> 02:23:53,425
leader of the Jabari tribe,

1705
02:23:53,595 --> 02:23:55,055
Son of Wakanda,

1706
02:23:56,555 --> 02:23:58,305
wish to challenge

1707
02:23:59,395 --> 02:24:00,555
for the throne.

1708
02:25:32,355 --> 02:25:33,755
What the hell is this?

1709
02:25:33,775 --> 02:25:36,195
Can we turn around?

1710
02:25:36,615 --> 02:25:38,575
I don't know, man.
We'll lose an hour.

1711
02:25:39,995 --> 02:25:41,405
Why don't you go check it out?

1712
02:25:41,495 --> 02:25:42,785
Okay.

1713
02:25:45,575 --> 02:25:46,875
Yeah, this is shauver.

1714
02:25:47,285 --> 02:25:49,295
Yeah, looks like we got a tree blocking our way.

1715
02:25:49,455 --> 02:25:51,165
How do you want us to proceed?

1716
02:25:51,255 --> 02:25:52,715
What the...

1717
02:26:03,345 --> 02:26:04,645
Ah!

1718
02:26:04,725 --> 02:26:07,055
A colonizer in chains.

1719
02:26:07,725 --> 02:26:09,775
Now I have seen everything.

1720
02:26:09,855 --> 02:26:10,985
Funny.

1721
02:26:35,715 --> 02:26:36,715
Merci.

1722
02:26:46,645 --> 02:26:47,645
Hey.

1723
02:26:52,315 --> 02:26:53,735
It's good to see you.

1724
02:26:54,485 --> 02:26:55,695
Everything is ready.

1725
02:26:55,855 --> 02:26:57,235
Just give me one moment, eh?

1726
02:26:57,405 --> 02:26:58,735
Actually,

1727
02:26:58,905 --> 02:27:00,775
I think I should do it on my own.

1728
02:27:01,985 --> 02:27:03,365
Of course.

1729
02:28:56,565 --> 02:28:59,985
Lift me up

1730
02:29:01,945 --> 02:29:05,365
hold me down

1731
02:29:07,325 --> 02:29:11,535
keep me close

1732
02:29:12,745 --> 02:29:16,125
safe and sound

1733
02:29:18,205 --> 02:29:22,965
burning in a hopeless dream

1734
02:29:23,465 --> 02:29:28,925
hold me when you go to sleep

1735
02:29:29,015 --> 02:29:32,595
keep me in the warmth of your love

1736
02:29:32,685 --> 02:29:35,855
when you depart keep me safe

1737
02:29:35,935 --> 02:29:38,065
safe and sound

1738
02:29:39,815 --> 02:29:43,155
lift me up

1739
02:29:45,115 --> 02:29:48,865
hold me down

1740
02:29:50,535 --> 02:29:54,455
keep me close

1741
02:29:55,955 --> 02:29:59,335
safe and sound

1742
02:30:01,295 --> 02:30:06,215
drowning in an endless sea

1743
02:30:06,545 --> 02:30:11,765
take some time and stay with me

1744
02:30:12,095 --> 02:30:16,435
keep me in the strength of your arms

1745
02:30:16,515 --> 02:30:19,105
keep me safe

1746
02:30:19,185 --> 02:30:21,355
safe and sound

1747
02:30:22,985 --> 02:30:26,615
lift me up

1748
02:30:28,485 --> 02:30:32,195
hold me down

1749
02:30:33,745 --> 02:30:37,915
keep me safe

1750
02:30:39,035 --> 02:30:42,205
safe and sound

1751
02:30:44,585 --> 02:30:49,885
burning in a hopeless dream

1752
02:30:49,965 --> 02:30:55,095
hold me when you go to sleep

1753
02:30:55,185 --> 02:30:59,305
keep me safe

1754
02:30:59,395 --> 02:31:04,235
we need light we need love

1755
02:31:06,235 --> 02:31:09,365
lift me up
lift me up

1756
02:31:09,445 --> 02:31:11,695
in your arms

1757
02:31:11,785 --> 02:31:14,905
hold me down
I need love, I need love

1758
02:31:14,995 --> 02:31:17,075
I need love

1759
02:31:17,165 --> 02:31:22,125
keep me safe
hold me

1760
02:31:22,205 --> 02:31:25,715
we need light we need love

1761
02:31:38,395 --> 02:31:39,395
Shuri,

1762
02:31:40,725 --> 02:31:42,435
can we join you now?

1763
02:31:45,525 --> 02:31:48,565
This is my son, Toussaint.

1764
02:31:49,735 --> 02:31:50,735
Toussaint,

1765
02:31:51,405 --> 02:31:54,535
this is your aunty, Shuri.

1766
02:32:17,885 --> 02:32:20,555
We agreed it was better for him to grow up here.

1767
02:32:20,725 --> 02:32:23,815
Away from the pressure of the throne.

1768
02:32:25,185 --> 02:32:26,395
Your father,

1769
02:32:27,025 --> 02:32:28,775
your baba,

1770
02:32:28,945 --> 02:32:31,615
prepared us for his death, didn't he?

1771
02:32:36,285 --> 02:32:38,325
But he didn't want us to go to the funeral

1772
02:32:39,155 --> 02:32:42,075
because he felt the time was not yet right.

1773
02:32:42,785 --> 02:32:45,585
So we had our own ceremony for him here.

1774
02:32:47,335 --> 02:32:48,915
Did my mother meet him?

1775
02:32:49,005 --> 02:32:50,005
She did.

1776
02:32:59,595 --> 02:33:00,725
It's nice to meet you.

1777
02:33:00,805 --> 02:33:02,095
Nice to meet you.

1778
02:33:02,265 --> 02:33:03,805
Toussaint is a beautiful name.

1779
02:33:04,305 --> 02:33:06,435
It holds a great history.

1780
02:33:06,605 --> 02:33:09,895
Thanks. Yours is cool, too, I guess.

1781
02:33:13,195 --> 02:33:15,365
My mom says you are good at keeping secrets.

1782
02:33:15,445 --> 02:33:16,445
Is that true?

1783
02:33:17,695 --> 02:33:20,495
Yes, I can keep a good secret.

1784
02:33:23,495 --> 02:33:25,785
Toussaint is my Haitian name.

1785
02:33:30,835 --> 02:33:33,045
My name is Prince T'Challa,

1786
02:33:33,135 --> 02:33:35,045
Son of King T'Challa.

1787
02:35:02,305 --> 02:35:08,015
I give my heart to this place

1788
02:35:10,355 --> 02:35:16,735
I give my soul or whatever it takes

1789
02:35:16,815 --> 02:35:18,905
never run away

1790
02:35:18,985 --> 02:35:25,155
I've got enough angels to storm the gates

1791
02:35:25,245 --> 02:35:27,245
I'm not afraid

1792
02:35:27,325 --> 02:35:31,375
behold the brave

1793
02:35:31,455 --> 02:35:35,255
and I'll have it, no other way

1794
02:35:35,335 --> 02:35:41,295
I missed the emergence and these moments of you

1795
02:35:41,425 --> 02:35:45,385
the mere reflection of me

1796
02:35:45,475 --> 02:35:49,305
that mirror can't change its view

1797
02:35:49,395 --> 02:35:52,225
so until those rivers run out

1798
02:35:52,315 --> 02:35:57,855
it runs through me wherever you are

1799
02:35:57,945 --> 02:35:59,775
I'll be there

1800
02:36:01,025 --> 02:36:04,195
we carry on

1801
02:36:06,405 --> 02:36:07,905
born again

1802
02:36:07,995 --> 02:36:12,245
I give my heart to this place

1803
02:36:12,325 --> 02:36:15,705
I give my heart to this place

1804
02:36:15,795 --> 02:36:22,095
I give my whole soul and whatever it takes

1805
02:36:22,465 --> 02:36:24,095
never run away

1806
02:36:24,215 --> 02:36:27,225
and I'd relive this

1807
02:36:27,305 --> 02:36:32,435
just to see your face again

1808
02:36:32,515 --> 02:36:38,065
I know that you'll do the same

1809
02:36:39,195 --> 02:36:40,695
born again

1810
02:36:40,775 --> 02:36:46,035
just tell me what I need to do

1811
02:36:48,905 --> 02:36:54,415
I'd die and come back just to love you

1812
02:36:57,165 --> 02:37:03,845
just tell me I'm begging you

1813
02:37:05,385 --> 02:37:11,225
just tell me what I need to do
