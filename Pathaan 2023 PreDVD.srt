00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,930
What are you looking at?
It's cancer

3
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,760
Not some pretty girl's
Instagram page

4
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,190
How long have I got?

5
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,530
Three years.

6
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,930
Maybe

7
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,890
The Indian government has made
the shocking decision today

8
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,830
to revoke Kashmir's special status

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,390
The Indian Parliament has unilaterally
announced Articl 370 is abrogated

10
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,890
Pakistan's Foreign Affairs Office has
condemned this unilateral action and said

11
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,430
that Pakistan will weigh up all
options and give a befitting response

12
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,060
Article 370 canceled

13
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,890
How can India do that?
This is wrong, sir

14
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,430
This is not wrong

15
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,760
It's a declaration of war

16
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,660
You said three years, right?

17
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,890
It’s long enough

18
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,930
Time for diplomacy has passed, sir.

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,030
If we wait for the UN resolution.

20
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,390
then India will take control of our Azad Kashmir next.

21
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,530
A man of God cannot cha enge them

22
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:32,830
A man God cannot challenge them

23
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,260
It's time to befwend the Devil

24
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,690
General Qadir for you

25
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,060
General Qadir, all in order?

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,160
Don't want order,
I want chaos

27
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,760
What do you want?

28
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,830
You sure?

29
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,930
Once that bullet is fired,
It won't go back into the gun

30
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,930
You need to be sure.
Can you do it?

31
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,430
It'll take time,
but it can be done

32
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,260
A radar can’t detect it,
no signal can stop it

33
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,830
It fears nothing, nor can it be
reasoned with.

34
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,160
Once it's launched,
it's like a djinn from Hell

35
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,060
Countdown to Judgement Day starts

36
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,260
Good. Jim will let you know
where to deliver it

37
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,890
Why? Doesn't he trust you?

38
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,530
Jim?

39
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,060
If God asked him to
name anything he wanted,

40
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,560
he'd say,
"Are You playi g a trick on me”?

41
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,930
Jim keeps his cards
close to his chest

42
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,060
Boss, is this man "Raafe"?

43
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,530
Why?

44
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,760
One man come.
He asked for Raafe

45
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,890
We say don't know Raafe

46
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,060
He say Raafe come to see Fayyad

47
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,430
Where is he?

48
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,930
VIP area, getting special treatment

49
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,060
Who are you"?

50
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,690
Hey, Hindi.

51
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,560
Speak up1

52
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,930
Talk in Hindi!

53
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,830
No fun swearing at you in Arabic

54
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,890
You'll take 5 seconds
to be surprised.

55
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,190
5 seconds to wonder where
you've heard this voice

56
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,760
And 5 more seconds
to get over your disbelief

57
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,190
Then you'll ask,

58
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,190
"Pathaan? You?"

59
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,190
Still alive

60
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,330
Where is she"?

61
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,890
How did you s rvive

62
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,830
Answer my question first.

63
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,690
Where is Rubai?

64
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,560
Uff! Mr Pathaan has a broken heart.

65
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,430
Love and perfume cannot be concealed.

66
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,690
She's far from your reach

67
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,690
Now you'll be going far away too

68
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,030
Any last message?

69
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,190
I have a gift for her

70
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,930
Your dancing bells are undone,
Raafe So dance!

71
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,830
Kill him!

72
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,430
What are you waiting for?

73
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,930
Kill him.

74
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,260
There's a storm coming, Raafe.

75
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,390
Fasten your seat belt.

76
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,930
Closed the door!

77
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,930
my way, B^run.

78
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,430
If you go on about the cake,
how can I finish my work?

79
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,430
Light the candles.
Start singing "Happy Birthday",

80
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,190
and I'll be home before
the candles go out

81
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,830
Ma' am, I've got all the information.
And it seems there's no problem.

82
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,930
Yeah. Check again.

83
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
I need all the information now.
Run it past the Finance Ministry.

84
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,330
Ma'am?

85
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:49,930
Ma'am'?

86
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,190
We have a red flag.

87
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,760
Our scanner has just identified someone

88
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,330
Our scanner has just identified someone.

89
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,560
Who is it?

90
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,190
Rubai?

91
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,690
Where?

92
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,560
Paris A security camera
at Palais Royal metro station.

93
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,660
- When?
-15 minutes ago, max.

94
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,430
Get a team on it right away.

95
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,030
Keep eyes on her. Do not intercept.

96
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,190
Get
ne.

97
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,160
Use the blue c nel. We need
permission for i ediate take-off

98
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,430
Yes, ma'am.

99
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,190
And ye

100
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,690
..to keep you a slice of cake in the fridge.

101
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,330
How much longer?

102
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,060
5 hours, max.

103
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,260
-	Ma'am?
-	Hmm?

104
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,190
Ma'am are we going after Pathaan?

105
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,890
What do you know about Pathaan?

106
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,930
Not much, ma'am.

107
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,830
Whenever he's mentioned,
everyone gets uncomfortable.

108
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,390
They change the subject.

109
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,190
Ma'am...is he on our side?

110
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,330
He was once.

111
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,330
Not just on our side,
he was our centre-forward

112
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,390
Opening batsman, opening bowler,

113
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,190
wicketkeeper and four slip
fielder too.

114
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,330
You know,if it weren't for Pathaan,

115
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,190
we would not be doing
what we do.

116
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,060
Nor would the JOCR Department exist

117
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,430
Two years ago, during a Myanmar mission,

118
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,060
Pathaan got badly injured

119
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,760
He lay in a hospital for weeks It was touch and go.

120
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:03,160
Everyone believed the Pathaan chapter was closed.

121
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,030
he was writing a whole new book.

122
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,560
I heard you got badly hurt.

123
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,530
Ma’am, yes.

124
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,660
I have a metal plate in my foot,
a titanium disc in my neck.

125
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,830
nd bio-absorbabl scrwes in my shoul

126
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,560
But you look very well.

127
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,560
It's tough My body goes beep. beep,
beep at airport security.

128
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,530
They keep detecting metal.

129
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,160
Looks like reti en doesn't suit you

130
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,430
Why?

131
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,330
Retirement can be peaceful, Pathaan.

132
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,430
There are so many ways to spend one's time.

133
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,830
Tomorrow we could be a MasterChef
and Indian Idol the next day

134
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,390
You need to get a hobby, Pathaan.

135
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,330
Is that Punjabi?

136
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,430
Japanese know you know what it means

137
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,430
I know

138
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,330
If precious 'Ottery breaks,

139
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,260
the Japanese put the broken pieces
together with molten i Id

140
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,690
The object looks stronger and more beautiful.

141
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,430
It's even considered more valuable.

142
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,160
Ma'am, look at this file

143
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,690
These are the broken pieces
of our organisation.

144
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,690
The ’ e s. diers like me.

145
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,190
Forced to retire because of injury or trauma

146
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,560
But they're not done yet.

147
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,930
They're still full of guts and passion

148
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:58,190
They’re ready to fight and die for india

149
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,260
So what do you want?
To form a new unit?

150
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,830
Yes, ma’am.

151
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,930
Do you realise how many people will nedd convincing?

152
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,190
There'll be so much red tape,
your hands will get glued to

153
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,060
Try it.

154
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,930
You think I've just been growing my hair out?

155
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,030
I've tried it. And better,
I've dont it

156
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,390
"Joint Operations and Covert Research" ma'am

157
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,760
No, ma'am.

158
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,530
Just returning my boss her chair

159
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,890
You were looking for a new ho y

160
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,430
Try Kintsugi, please.

161
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:59,430
These broken soldiers need new eaning in their lives

162
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,890
They're ready for a mission

163
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,930
You are the molten gqld who can put them toge her

164
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,760
Stronger than before.

165
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,330
more dangerous

166
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,830
That was the birth of Team JOCR

167
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,560
Every important mission for India

168
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:42,390
that was our playground.
We had no rules to stop us

169
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,190
So obviously anyone who loved rules

170
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:50,430
had a problem with us. Like our Colonel Luthra

171
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,030
Wow!

172
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,690
Beautiful

173
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,760
Very beautiful

174
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,560
This space was reserved for a recreational
club for us and other departments1

175
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,660
A gym, sauna, pool tables, etc.

176
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,690
auna? Pool tables?

177
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,760
Excuse me, sir, you can't be serious

178
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,060
- These people are my officers .
-They're not officers.

179
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,390
You've made JOCR with some broken jokers

180
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,830
They're just broken eggshells

181
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,890
How dare you!

182
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,560
Good invention, guys

183
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,830
- Rishi, well done! -Thankyou, sir

184
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,160
- Did you think I actually.
- No, ma'am.

185
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,560
Oh, come on, Pathaan I was just playing along

186
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,930
Would I talk to a superior like that?

187
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,160
No. never

188
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,560
Don't be a child.

189
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,030
I admit Rishi's invention is very real

190
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,560
But Pathaan. you can't mess with me

191
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,330
- Is this a bad time?
- No, sir.

192
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,390
He looks a little pale

193
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,560
And he has those bags under his eyes, which you guys missed

194
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,890
Have you seen
Luthra's double chin?

195
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,690
It hangs down to his belly

196
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,430
And Luthra's paunch?

197
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,330
Very good.

198
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,430
Very serious department

199
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,030
Now I can make my recommendations to the Defence Secretary

200
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:20,560
I told you you're broken eggshells.
That's all

201
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,430
Paunch, ma'am!

202
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:23,930
Sir. Sir.

203
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,660
Sir. now that you're here, wait two minutes, please

204
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,330
I must show you something

205
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,930
Aeroflot 394C -144 casualties

206
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,560
Daeshca camed it was their doing

207
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,060
Daesh claimed it was their doing

208
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,760
Norwegian ship, Asgard

209
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,530
Pirates de
he Gulf o

210
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,690
Biggest ecological disaster of the decade.

211
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,160
Courtesy Boko Haram.

212
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,560
Chemical attack on the Japanese

213
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,390
The Japanese outfit Aleph claimed responsibility.

214
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,930
You think I have no intel on all this?

215
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,760
No, sir It wasn't Aleph

216
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,830
Or  Boko Haram or Daesh

217
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,030
At least, they weren't directly involved.

218
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,690
They outsourced these attacks to a private terrorist group

219
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,430
They wo k ®n contract, not for ideological reasons

220
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,830
Really?

221
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,160
errorists are corporations now?

222
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,390
Let's say a group like this exists, so what?

223
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,430
They’re Interpol's problem, not India’s.

224
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,190
Actually sir, now it is.

225
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,830
ually sir, now it is

226
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,690
Because their next episode s an India special

227
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,190
And this is a big one.

228
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,430
Sir, through the darknet we found out that

229
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,190
Outfit X is planning something big in Dubai.

230
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,330
At the Asian Scientific Confere

231
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,930
two Indian scientists will repre nt India and our...

232
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,930
At the  conference our President

233
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,190
ing the keynote address

234
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,330
They're after the President.

235
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,560
We Think so, sir.

236
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,930
I'll make sure the security is tripled.

237
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,330
They won't get near the President

238
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,430
-Thankyou, sir.
-Thank you.

239
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,830
Another request, sir

240
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,930
these...

241
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,760
eggsh
e with e

242
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,330
Trust me, Luthra.

243
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,930
You look after the President's security.

244
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,930
I changed the President's travel itinerary at the last minute

245
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,690
No sign of explosives

246
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,430
There are no spots for a siper to hide

247
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,560
Absolutely nothing suspicious

248
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,190
Intel was real, sir

249
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,890
But now there's radio silence

250
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,430
They've become more careful or.

251
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,930
Sir, you said you changed the President's travel route

252
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:32,760
What was it before?

253
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,160
He was to travel with the two scientists
and the press

254
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,530
Showing support for science.

255
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,190
Now he's taking another route
With full security

256
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,890
What about our scientists'?
Will they travel with the President"?

257
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,260
No. Multiple vehicles make security tricky

258
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,160
I want our NSG commandos to focus on the President

259
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,530
So the two scientists who had NSG cover,

260
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,690
no longer have it

261
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,060
Damn it’

262
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,060
They tricked us into changing the travel itinerary.

263
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,330
eir target is not the President, sir.

264
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,060
I was hoping to take a selfie with the President

265
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,190
with the President

266
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,430
and impress the missus’

267
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,030
You still want to impress her, after thirty years'?

268
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,060
Science s ea y Farooqui. Love is hard

269
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,560
Sir, we've been attacked.

270
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,690
You were right, Pathaan.

271
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,190
They've attack d the scientists' convoy

272
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,560
Lock me to the scientists' phone

273
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,660
- On it sir
- Now'

274
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,690
Wait. Don't shoot!

275
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,190
Wait Don’t shoot!

276
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,690
Dr. Sahani, Dr. Farooqui.

277
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,890
Take my advice.
Be more scared than you are

278
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,560
You're pretty screwed.

279
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,190
He's got the scientists in a grey Hummer. Pathaan

280
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,530
Sir, I've sent you the Hummer’s location

281
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,430
There's the Hummer sir

282
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,690
Pathaan, I've been waiting for a long time to meet you

283
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,530
I heard a lot about you when I was in RAW.

284
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,690
They call me "Jim"

285
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,190
Jim?

286
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,190
You probably heard I was dead.

287
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,830
So?

288
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,930
Well, I am actually dead for India

289
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,030
Here's the proof.

290
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,160
Bravery award.

291
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,760
I died a bloody hero

292
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,830
How come, Jim?

293
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,560
-I heard you...
- ...were the best?

294
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,530
You heard right I still am

295
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,930
She broke my heart

296
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,560
She'll break yours too.

297
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,690
The difference is I considered myself her lover,

298
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,530
and you think you're her s

299
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,830
Mother India!

300
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,330
You're lucky.

301
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:42,030
You'll die believing your patriotism meant something.

302
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,830
I'm sure they'll t for bravery on
medal for bravery you grave

303
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,560
They'll call you a martyr.

304
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,060
But cost to the country?

305
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,190
Zero.

306
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,160
If life was different, perhaps we'd be friends.

307
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,160
What a pity!

308
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,560
We have to play the cards we're dealt.

309
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:10,560
And in this round, I hold all the aces.

310
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,190
Raza! Rishi!

311
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,060
Rishi

312
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,330
- My seat belt.
-I was stuck.

313
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,430
Pathaan, my seat belt.

314
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:34,690
Rishi'

315
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,690
- My legs are stuck.
- Come on

316
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,430
My leg is stuck, sir.

317
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,390
Rishi.

318
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,430
- My leg is stuck.
- Rishi.

319
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,660
Pathaan!

320
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:58,660
Sir, my leg is stuck.

321
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,330
Sir my leg is stuck.

322
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,930
- We must go Pathaan!
-Wait1

323
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,330
- Raza'
- The car is about to explode!

324
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:02,760
- Raza!
- The car is about to explode!

325
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,930
- Take him away!
- There's nothing you can do.

326
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,760
Pathaan, we must go.
- Go, sir.

327
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:07,830
Nothing we can do

328
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,190
Sir, it's been an honour.

329
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,430
We must go, Pathaan!

330
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:12,930
Pathaan!

331
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,830
Jai Hin

332
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,830
Block the road.

333
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,190
These choppers won't fly through the tunnel.

334
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,330
they'll crash int he building.

335
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:16,830
key'll r to the buildin

336
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,390
Well, Pathaan? What next?

337
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,330
Their lives hang by this rope.

338
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,190
Only you can untie the knot

339
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,830
So, what's it gonn be. budd

340
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,430
mpnon sense?

341
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,760
Say hello to Mother India

342
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,030
Tell her I'm coming soon

343
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,260
I've a score to settle.

344
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,060
Jim.

345
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,030
Can't trust dead men to stay dead.

346
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,160
Was m working for RAW?

347
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,890
Jim and Kabir.

348
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,930
Our best agents.

349
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:23,060
They were quite similar

350
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,330
Calculative, precise, methodical

351
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,060
He first listens to his heart, then to his superiors.

352
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,190
- So, what went wrong? -A job.

353
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,830
So, what went wrong?

354
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:43,430
Remember the ONCC drilling team
the Somalian priates kidnapped?

355
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,430
Jim went solo

356
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:51,760
He managed to save six hostages, totally unharmed.

357
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,830
The pirates swore to take revenge.

358
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,660
They finally tracked Jim down.

359
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:03,430
They asked for a ransom of 100 million in exchange for Jim and his wife

360
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:07,430
But we don't negotiate with terrorists

361
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,190
You love your country too much.

362
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,190
But your country,

363
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,760
no love you.

364
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,260
No! No!

365
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,060
No!

366
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,160
No!

367
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:49,690
No. Please leave her

368
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,190
No!

369
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,830
No!

370
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,160
No!

371
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,760
We never found Jim's body. So we assumed he was dead.

372
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,690
Jim was given a medal, the bravery award

373
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:23,160
One of his uncles received it.

374
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:29,060
Couldn't you have paid the ransom for an agent like him and his family?

375
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,060
Your department does not lack funds,

376
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,690
Our funds can't be wasted ersonal matters

377
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,190
Such honesty, sir!

378
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:43,190
What if it was a minister's family'?

379
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:46,530
Only the weak go down on their knees, Pathaan.

380
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,760
Not soldiers.

381
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,260
Your decision has convinced him that his actions are justified.

382
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,060
And now

383
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,930
Shweta, check for leads on the darknet.

384
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,560
- Raktbee
- What's that?

385
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,190
- Raktbeej. Sounds like a codeword.
- For a man? Or an object?

386
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,190
Have the dead in Dubai been identified?

387
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,690
Yes sir.
All ex-soldiers or secret agents.

388
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,660
They recently received money transfers.

389
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,690
From one account?

390
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,430
Yes. From a Pakistani doctor Rubina Mohsin

391
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,930
She lives in London.

392
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,830
Her account was inactive for months. Then these transfers were made

393
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,830
Who knows if she was even awar

394
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,930
The bank would've alerted her about the transfers.

395
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,530
We've hacked her emails. She hasn't logged in for a month.

396
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,930
Her phone is off too

397
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,260
She's taking a flight

398
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,690
Where to?

399
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:16,330
t was sh be o

400
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:16,660
5hje‘ be off

401
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,260
If it was another agent, she'd be lea or Syria.

402
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,690
As it’s you -

403
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,260
it's Spain.

404
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:26,530
I'm desperate for a vacation.

405
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,930
Tonight

406
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:32,930
life is complete

407
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,060
In this instant

408
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,530
life is rich

409
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,760
My heart has been robbed

410
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,560
by m lovers

411
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,430
How they torment me

412
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,660
Tnese crazy thoughts of mine

413
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,660
The moment I feel a wave of modesty

414
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,930
throw it to the ind

415
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,830
The world has not seen my true colours

416
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,830
Shweta, I'm sending you info on Dr. Rubina Mohsin. Check it.

417
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,060
I'm like a breath of fresh air

418
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,060
My style, my habits all new

419
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,830
I never  follow the right path

420
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,330
The path of wrong sopfWting

421
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,830
Tonight...

422
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,060
In this instant

423
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:28,330
In this mst

424
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,330
life is rich

425
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,330
life is rich

426
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,190
When I feel a wave of modesty

427
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:42,190
I throw it to the wind

428
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,260
The world has not seen my true colours

429
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,290
Throw a few seeds on the
ground and the ants come drawing

430
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,690
A bank account, a SIM can

431
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,660
And Pathaan appears in flesh and blood.

432
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,830
The hunter...

433
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,660

441
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,430

Only the names of the corpses change.

Women!

00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,190
Yours, ma'am

463
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,760
Are you ex-ISI?

464
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:23,190
Not ex.

465
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,660
You thought you were the only ones monitoring Outfit X.

466
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,660
I've  been with them for a year, undercover.

467
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,690
Why all this?

468
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:37,930
With you. we'll get what I want faster

469
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:39,430
When did we beco e a we"?

470
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,390
When did we become a 'we”?

471
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:43,690
When I saved your life.

472
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,160
You endangered it

473
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,830
You know that, right?

474
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,190
- Run.
- Where are you?

475
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:51,830
Run
- where are you?

476
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:54,660
W e are going?

477
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,160
-Wait'
- Duck

478
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,830
You aim well.

479
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,930
So do they.

480
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,690
Father!

481
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,690
Morning.

482
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:10,890
You were out for 18 hours.

483
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,330
Take it easy.

484
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:15,560
Fever's down.

485
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:18,760
No Infection. And luckily the bullet dn't touch any vital organ.

486
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:21,060
You were calling for your father and crying

487
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:24,160
You kept asking them to let your father go

488
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:26,760
Father

489
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,190
He was a journalist in the Middle East

490
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,560
He asked too many questions

491
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,160
Printed too many answers

492
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,060
So he was brutally tortured

493
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:41,560
and we were made to watch from the front row

494
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:45,830
Then you went to Pakistan with your mother and joined medical college

495
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,430
Dr. Rubina Mohsin.

496
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:56,430
Affer  that, to serve humanity.

497
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:58,930
you joined the ISI.

498
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:07,430
Oh. Of course

499
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:14,660
Cheers

500
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,430
Couldn't you find a cheaper

501
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,830
is we have big budgets

502
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,030
But seriously,

503
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,260
why did you save my life?

504
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,530
Aren't your good looks and personality enough?

505
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,930
Normally they are. I'm so sexy.

506
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:48,830
You said we’d get what you wanted faster with me.

507
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:54,060
So I want to know, what do "we" want?

508
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,060
Raktbeej.

509
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,190
Heard the name?

510
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,690
He was a demon.

511
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:05,530
Wherever a drop of his blood fell,

512
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,930
another Raktbeej was born

513
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:11,330
Basically, it was impossible to destroy Raktbeej.

514
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:19,060
Whatever this Raktbeej is. it's in Russia

515
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:25,190
In 7 days ..what?

516
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,930
Jim will take deliver bf Raktbeej in 7 day

517
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:32,560
Then all hell break loose

518
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,790
basicatl ehave...

519
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:41,890
Bottoms up!

520
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:48,430
Think you skipped school the day
they spoke about ISI and India.

521
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:52,560
You see we don't get on so well.

522
00:48:54,260 --> 00:49:00,690
Besides, the first day we met, you put Jim's gun against my head. Remember?

523
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,160
So don't take it personally

524
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:05,830
ave few trust issues.

525
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,060
Some things are more important
than trust issues

526
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:10,690
Like these 7 day

527
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,930
So ar ou in?
Or are you out?

528
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,260
Russia's a big place

529
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,660
Do you know the address'? Any landmark?

530
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,560
You know Something

531
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,560
Vault 412, Moscow Woskwich Tower

532
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:44,060
You moust know the address

533
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:47,690
You were Posted in Russia for three years

534
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,120
What else do you know about me?

535
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,260
Do you want me to tell you everything now?

536
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,280
Scary

537
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,160
An ISI agent tells us there's something in Moscow that Jim’s after.

538
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:00,060
Yes, ma'am.

539
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,560
I've heard about R'aktbeej on the darknet.

540
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,560
Do you know what it is?

541
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,830
So, let's hope Whever it is. it stays unknown.

542
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,160
I know you're fcfrniliar with every corner of Russia

543
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:20,060
But Russia is still a friendly country and a crucial ally.

544
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,030
A scandal will not be tolerated in Moscow or in Delhi.

545
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:26,760
Ma'am you know
Jim Wants Raktbeej.

546
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,190
If he can't buy it. he'll steal it.

547
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,690
And if you get caught?

548
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,060
Don't try negotiating for me.

549
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:37,690
I'm not Jim.

550
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,530
Damn it!

551
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:44,030
Whatever Raktbeej is,

552
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,530
neither Jim nor ISI should get their hands on it.

553
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:50,160
Go, get it!

554
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,190
Welcome.

555
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,160
Sir. me show you around

556
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:01,260
Same to you.

557
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:05,690
-	For an English dictionary
-	Thank you, sir. Thank you.

558
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,690
You need anything, contact Andrei.

559
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:10,330
You have a great honeymoon

560
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,560
You didn't tell me we were on our honeymoon.

561
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,930
If you had denied it, it would've broken Andrei’s heart.

562
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,830
Look. What a stunning-view!

563
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,060
Wow!

564
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:31,760
I never thought I'd see such a big
building on my wedding night!

565
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,560
If you stay with me, there's more fun to come.

566
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:37,330
Many corporates have their offices in that building.

567
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,260
W08KWI0H TOWER

568
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,430
The 92nd loor
osts

569
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:43,690
The 92nd floor is hdme to the orld's most secure vault

570
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,890
The vault.is a 30ft x 30ft room

571
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,830
No y or explosive can open it

572
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,560
No laser can cut through.
No acid'burn through

573
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:58,830
Can't cut it, can't break it.
Can’t blow it up, can't burn it.

574
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:03,560
But. but. but. there's only one problem

575
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:08,560
The vault has a lock and key
but two different people have them

576
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:10,160
So when you need to open it.

577
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:12,760
an uncle brings the lock from his home

578
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,690
and an aunty brings the key

579
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:19,430
The lock and key meet like the union of the Ganges and Jamuna

580
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:29,330
So. must we steal both lock and key?

581
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,890
Yes, exactly

582
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,060
But there's a complication

583
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,000
The lock is 12 kms away in Uncle Grigr's Office

584
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:40,160
And the key is 16kms away with Aunty Karen

585
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:47,060
And of course, their offices are in opposite direction

586
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,530
And the best part?'

587
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,930
We must get to the vault in 10 minutes once we've stolen them

588
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,330
I love this sugar-free yoghurt.

589
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,060
As soon as the lock and key are removed.

590
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,160
a timer starts ticking.

591
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:05,890
Within 10 minutes, at FSB h someone must enter an "all-
a s, c e .

592
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,690
This confirms all's well and it's not Rubai and Pathaan

593
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,160
-	Or else...
-	Or else?

594
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:19,160
I lockdown T

595
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:22,690
Lock, key or prayer . nothing makes a nee.

596
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,760
Unless the system is re et in three places

597
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:29,630
Game over

598
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:33,190
How can we reach the vau in 10 minutes in Moscow tna

599
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:36,690
Step 1 To get to the main lock, we must first open another lock

600
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:42,330
To open tna.t we need Uncle Grigor's fingerprints

601
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,190
-Any cops in sight? -Why?

602
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,160
Because you’re looking like a bomb!

603
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,830
Have a blast. -Oh, I will.

604
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:30,390
jlLIOOQ

605
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:33,190
Step 2

606
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,430
Our key-holding Aunty Karen

607
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,330
- You'll seduce her?
- / wish

608
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,560
I'm not her type

609
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:44,930
She'll be knocked out by some sleeping pills

610
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:05,060
You are my Karen!

611
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,190
Good night, K-K-K-Karen.

612
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,560
Step 3 we need tow planes. And tow pilots

613
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:23,560
Absolute professionals

614
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,060
You picked this place?

615
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,260
Pilots? Right.

616
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:35,930
They're lats. Very professional.

617
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:41,030
Actually, flying is just their hobby

618
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:43,830
Professi , They're singers.

619
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:49,190
-	Singers?
-	Singers.

620
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,260
What about the bill?

621
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:06,690
Rubai, listen. You'll have some cheese?

622
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,330
Never mind It's fun.

623
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:20,160
Are you and the missus looking for anything in particular?

624
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:22,560
Very particular

625
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,390
How would you like to earn 20,000 boobies'?

626
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,160
Rubles'

627
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,930
What did I say?

628
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,330
I meant rdbles.

629
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:51,930
We have a meeting with Raktbeej. Our final step.

630
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,830
Tomorrow we have an appointment with Raktbeej, so..

631
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:19,830
Get some rest

632
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,530
This may be our last night outside a Russian jail.

633
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,190
Then we shouldn't waste it

634
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:31,260
Yeah! Waste is not good.

635
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,330
Maybe I..

636
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,190
Could you help with my bandages?

637
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,660
Bandages? Of course

638
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,830
Nothing better I'd like to do than change your bandages.

639
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:45,530
Pathaan.

640
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,160
I mean, you're actually a Pathaan?

641
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,830
Are you a Muslim’’

642
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:57,030
Rubai, I don't know what I am. Who I am.

643
00:58:57,830 --> 00:58:59,930
Or who my parents were

644
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:04,930
Or why I was abandoned in front of a cinema.

645
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:11,190
Landed up in an orphanage, then a juvenile centre,

646
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:13,760
then a remand home

647
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:22,930
So, it was really my country that raised me

648
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,330
I wanted to be a good son

649
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,330
and serve my parents Pay them back

650
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,560
So I joined the Indian army

651
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:43,660
- I'm sorry.
- It’s OK

652
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,160
By the way.

653
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,390
what film was playing at the cinema where tiey left you?

654
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:58,690
You don't take emotions seriously'?

655
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:01,930
Do you?

656
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,060
Never

657
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:13,330
So how did you turn from Lawaaris to Khuda Gawah?

658
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:15,560
It was in 2002

659
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:19,190
I was in Afghanistan on a joint mission with the US army

660
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:21,930
My first mission

661
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,930
The US target that day was a Salauddin Hussemi

662
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,390
a Taliban leader

663
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:27,830
A missile was locked on to the location of his phone

664
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:38,430
This Mr. Husseini was a teacher in a madrasa

665
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:41,190
People started to run

666
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:45,330
The problem was there were
30 kids still in the madrasa

667
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,030
and the missile was to strike in one minute

668
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:51,260
The missile was heading for the madrasa

669
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,690
The kids were still inside

670
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:18,060
I was in a coma for a month

671
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:25,830
A day did not go by without someone in that village praying for me

672
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,060
Subhanallah

673
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:39,690
-	Adaab.
-	Salaam.

674
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:44,830
Everyone has been praying for your good health

675
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:48,430
I swear, no Pathaan mother

676
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:52,060
has ever given birth to someone as brave as you.

677
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:55,560
From today, we are yours and you are ours.

678
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,830
Our Pathaan

679
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,190
You know what?

680
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:10,830
Every year without fail I try

681
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:15,190
and celebrate Eid with everyone in that village

682
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:20,690
With my Pathaan family

683
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,260
Once we have the bag we have 10 minutes Don't forget

684
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:05,390
- Rubai, start your timer alarm

685
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:11,690
Karen, do you have a copy.

686
01:04:12,830 --> 01:04:13,430
Who are you?

687
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:24,330
Rubai'

688
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:24,930
Rubai'.

689
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:27,160
I have a release malfunction

690
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,530
Rubai, when you're above the building, cut your rope.

691
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:43,060
Captain, listen to me.

692
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:46,030
Are you crazy?

693
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,560
Just do it.

694
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,330
What the ?

695
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:21,930
We're 90 seconds late In a minute the alarm will go off. Let's go!

696
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:23,830
We're 90 seconds late In a minute the alarm will go off Let’s go!

697
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:27,660
- Vault number? -412

698
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:46,330
How do these steps open?

699
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:47,560
No time for that

700
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:01,160
Here

701
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:05,190
Throw it to me

702
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:15,030
Pathaan,

703
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:16,930
I'm sorry.

704
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,930
It's impossible to open that vault

705
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,330
It is possible. For Pathaan

706
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,260
Pathaan? Why would he help you?

707
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:47,260
- Mat --check

708
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:49,260
You mean "checkmate ?

709
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,830
When the king tl inks the queen will sacrifice herself for him

710
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,760
all his concentration is on saving the queen

711
01:09:01,330 --> 01:09:04,660
When the king realises the queen has switched sides, it'll be

712
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,390
Checkmate

713
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:12,560
The king is dead

714
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,330
The king is dead.

715
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,190
Pathaan was put into a high security prison

716
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:48,090
That's where I last saw him

717
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:07,430
He's not with us.

718
01:10:08,430 --> 01:10:12,090
Oh please. Miss Grewal, we know he's Marcos’s agent

719
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,830
He was. He went rogue.

720
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:17,590
Do.you think we would sanction this stupidity?

721
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,990
Whatever he's done, we have no stake in it.

722
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,490
So you don't care how we deal with this situation?

723
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,990
Be my guest

724
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,730
And if this "situation" survives,

725
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:34,090
pump him with two bullets from me.

726
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:36,930
I'll reimburse you

727
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:39,360
going t crush your bones t owder

728
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:42,490
You're a dead man walking.

729
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,590
What was he saying?

730
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,990
I'm going to kill you.

731
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:06,190
Guys. Timeout, guys!

732
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:07,590
Please.

733
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,830
Stopped at a coffee sh p?

734
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:03,730
And a pharmac

735
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:04,190
And a pharmacy

736
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,090
Here. Painkillers

737
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:08,330
Men don't feel pain

738
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:11,230
Take them, brother

739
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,360
They're coming

740
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:39,860
You've taken it easy too long Let's get to work.

741
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:06,060
Tiger, he's got a grenade

742
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,990
- So what!
-I have the pin.

743
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:11,730
When will you stop pulling pins?

744
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,560
I'm sorry

745
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:36,730
I’m having a blast.
Are you9

746
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:39,730
Oh man!

747
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:51,930
Behind you!

748
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:15,490
Mission accomplished!

749
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,230
Did they come for you?

750
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,490
For you

751
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,930
You made big trouble, didn't you?

752
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:29,330
I'm a Pathaan

753
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:31,360
- Shall we run?
- Me first

754
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:52,990
You got scared, right?

755
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,590
I know.

756
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:55,830
For you.

757
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:45,830
Look back!

758
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:43,990
Run Pathaan. run.

759
01:18:45,250 --> 01:19:17,065
T.me/Moviezindian

760
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:20,690
Listen

761
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:23,590
I'm going on a big mission.

762
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,360
Tiger may need Pathaan.

763
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:28,860
So stay alive.

764
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,930
I will. I’ll be there.

765
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:35,830
Oh, man I promise.

766
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,230
- Don't need promises.
- Then what?

767
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,490
I need those painkillers.

768
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,590
Oh, painkillers. It's here.

769
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:46,230
This is yours, this is mine.

770
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:53,990
Bitter isn't it

771
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:55,990
It's a painkiller. Not chewing gum

772
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,860
So, Tiger helped Pathaan in Russia?

773
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,590
How come Pathaan was missing for so long?

774
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,060
That was the first time anyone
had defeated Pathaan

775
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:08,490
He swore

776
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,090
without Rubai, Jim and Raktbeej

777
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,930
To maintain diplomatic relations with ussia

778
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,730
Pathaan's absence suited us.

779
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:20,560
And now?

780
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,230
The time of  Pathaan's exile is over.

781
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:49,860
"Pump him with two bullets from me."

782
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:54,060
What could I have said? Pathaan's like a son to me.

783
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:56,430
don't torture him too much."

784
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:59,490
Why did Luthra let you go to Russia?

785
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,860
Don't ask. He wanted to go himself

786
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,730
He would've shot you point-blank

787
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:10,230
if he knew the reason I went there wa to give you

788
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,930
a message.

789
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:16,830
He's not with us

790
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:33,090
Did Raafe tell you anything?

791
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,730
Jim bought two Saber missiles

792
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:38,730
He doesn't know why.

793
01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:40,230
ot where Jim is

794
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,860
where she is.

795
01:21:51,730 --> 01:21:53,590
Paris? When?

796
01:21:54,230 --> 01:21:55,830
A e urs ago

797
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,230
Activity?

798
01:21:58,560 --> 01:21:59,730
Walks, cafes.

799
01:21:59,730 --> 01:22:00,230
Walks.

800
01:22:01,730 --> 01:22:02,090
s she's waiting someone.

801
01:22:02,230 --> 01:22:04,730
Perhaps st es waiting for so

802
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:07,990
n I have to go.

803
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:12,060
nt keep a girl waiting.

804
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:16,230
Pathaan, I do you stole from the Russians,

805
01:22:16,730 --> 01:22:19,490
but I've never seen them so tense

806
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,090
Find it

807
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:24,190
Find Jim

808
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:26,490
Ma'am

809
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:32,230
Salaam Alaikum

810
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:36,590
Wa' alaikumu s- salaam.
May Peace be upon on you too

811
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:39,360
Thank you. Raza

812
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:46,330
In romantic Paris - two's company, three's a crowd

813
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:49,990
I must talk to her about the pleasures of love.

814
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:52,730
Alone

815
01:23:58,360 --> 01:23:59,230
Thank you.

816
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:07,490
I fgured when I'd see you again,

817
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:09,990
d shoot you first,

818
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:12,360
then ask questions.

819
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:19,730
But you called me here your own accord, so

820
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:24,360
Of course, Rubai.

821
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,360
we conveniently got your photo at the Paris metro.

822
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,360
You knew I'd see that CCTV footage. And I would

823
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:37,690
come to you.

824
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:41,990
So well, I'm here. Tell me quickly what you have to say.

825
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,360
Raktbeej

826
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:50,230
You want to know what it is?

827
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:52,190
What is it?

828
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:53,860
• ••I
•••• ••••ft*

829
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:54,590
• •••

830
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,590
Smallpox?

831
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:02,590
It was eradicated in 1980.

832
01:25:04,230 --> 01:25:09,360
Yes, but some research facilities still have samples of the virus,

833
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,090
in case we need to fight smallpox again.

834
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:16,230
The virus samples were in Russia.

835
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:17,990
We stole them.

836
01:25:19,730 --> 01:25:21,090
But why?

837
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:25,330
Every country in this world has a vaccine against smallpox

838
01:25:28,430 --> 01:25:30,360
In case of an emergency outbreak.

839
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,190
The vaccine works against the old smallpox virus.

840
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:37,360
Jim has mutated it.

841
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:41,990
The mutated virus is far more dangerous.

842
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:45,990
We have no vaccine against it. r No cure either.

843
01:25:46,930 --> 01:25:51,990
That’s why he planned the big operation in Dubai to kidnap Dr. Sahani.

844
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:03,830
Who for? Who's paying him?

845
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,830
Do you know General Qadir?

846
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,730
It:s*time to befnienti the Devil

847
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:18,730
- Your government?

848
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:21,990
The General joined forces with ISI extremists

849
01:26:22,830 --> 01:26:26,090
when India abrogated Article 370.

850
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:28,690
Pathaan I swear,

851
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,230
I had no idea at all

852
01:26:34,430 --> 01:26:38,490
that my own people would do such a mad thing.

853
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:41,090
If this virus spreads,

854
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:44,690
how can Pakistan save itself?

855
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,490
He has changed the virus's DNA.

856
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:51,490
It does not follow the one-week pattern like Covid-19.

857
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:54,190
This kills within a few hours.

858
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:58,590
Anyone infected by this virus cannot go very far.

859
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:03,990
It decimates a whole city in a matter of days, once it spreads.

860
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:07,330
But it can also be contained within a city's borders

861
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,730
It attacks one city at a time.

862
01:27:11,730 --> 01:27:12,990
Not the whole world.

863
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,590
But how, Rubai?

864
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:22,860
So why do you think I can trust you again?

865
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:26,860
I'm a soldier, Pathaan.

866
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:28,930
Like you,

867
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:32,330
I will do anything for my country.

868
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:34,190
But this?

869
01:27:35,230 --> 01:27:39,430
Killing thousands of innocents? This is not my idea of war.

870
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,430
Trust me, Pathaan.

871
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,590
Just once more.

872
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:54,860
I'll always have my eye on you.

873
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:57,560
One wrong move...

874
01:27:57,730 --> 01:28:00,330
I've made all the wrong moves I had to.

875
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:03,060
Now I want them erased.

876
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:06,690
Where's Jim?

877
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:11,490
He's meeting Dr. Sahani in his lab in two days.

878
01:28:14,730 --> 01:28:16,330
Tell me about this lab.

879
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,230
Everything.

880
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:45,830
Rubai'

881
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:50,730
ooking good.

882
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:51,990
Aiwa s.

883
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,230
But you haven't noticed me before.

884
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:56,990
Who says love is only at first sight?

885
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:08,360
Want to drown in them?

886
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,930
I know the difference between the sea and lava.

887
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:30,690
Did you design the virus as instructed?

888
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:46,860
Are you really going to do this?

889
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:48,490
you really going to do this?

890
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:50,590
For money?

891
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:53,230
You think this is about money?

892
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:56,860
I could’ve easily robbed a bank blindfolded Doctor

893
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,090
I was asked a question once

894
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:03,730
"What's your price?

895
01:30:05,830 --> 01:30:07,990
"The price of your family?

896
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,490
"Your child?"

897
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,690
Today you h my answer.

898
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:19,230
It's I who will decide the price of you life

899
01:30:20,830 --> 01:30:23,330
Do you have ower to buy me? So buy me

900
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:25,560
This is crazy

901
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:28,990
These are your own people

902
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:30,690
Your own country

903
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:34,990
Oh, Doc! Country, borders, etceter

904
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:38,690
They exist to remind the weak to stay in their place

905
01:30:38,930 --> 01:30:40,990
While the real machines keep turning:

906
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:43,490
power and control.

907
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:47,230
I don't care for any coun

908
01:30:47,730 --> 01:30:51,330
My country is wherever I ha to be.

909
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:53,830
That’s my world.

910
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,490
Let me check.

911
01:31:38,930 --> 01:31:40,190
If anything 
?ia pens to these orbs, then c t our own throat.

912
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,330
Dr. Saham Dr Sahani.

913
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:07,990
Give me the orbs

914
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:22,860
The orbs are safe. Let's go

915
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:27,360
Jim, I was trying to
Raktbeej safe...

916
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:30,360
Normally when you lie, it's so smoothly done

917
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,690
I’m touched you're scared of me.

918
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,590
- Jim, trust me, I...
- Explain to your people

919
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,990
how you betrayed them.

920
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,430
General Qadir is not "my people".

921
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:48,060
When my people hear what he's done,

922
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:50,430
they'll bloody hang hi

923
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,360
I have a daughter.

924
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:59,860
I wanted you to stay alive for her sake.

925
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:07,590
Bag?

926
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:01,330
He must be close

927
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:39,230
Give it to me, Pathaan.

928
01:37:39,230 --> 01:37:39,730
Giv o me, Pathaan.

929
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:41,360
No, sir. We have to destroy it.

930
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,930
Absolutely not.

931
01:37:45,730 --> 01:37:48,230
Jim has mutated the smallpox virus.

932
01:37:48,830 --> 01:37:50,230
so v/e' need to make a vaccine.

933
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:51,490
-1 don't think so, sir
- Give it to me.

934
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:00,060
Pathaan!

935
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:03,090
What the hell, sir?
What's going on?

936
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,430
She's ISI, PatRaan

937
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:06,990
We have the virus orb, thanks to her.

938
01:38:07,330 --> 01:38:09,230
And thanks to her, the virus landed in Jim's hands.

939
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:11,830
She knows Jim's plans.

940
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:16,360
- We have to question her, Pathaan.
- Ma'am...

941
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:17,930
Besides, where can she go now?

942
01:38:18,330 --> 01:38:20,330
Jim and the ISI are looking for her.

943
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:23,990
If we let her go, she won't survive for two days.

944
01:38:25,330 --> 01:38:26,730
- Take her.
- Wait

945
01:38:33,930 --> 01:38:34,860
Pathaan...

946
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:38,560
You'll be OK.

947
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:42,490
Pathaan's promise.

948
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,360
Ma'am, you'll have to wear this suit

949
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:09,830
Yes, Doctor?

950
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:11,360
I got your message

951
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:12,990
Come. Nandini must w y mething

952
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:16,160
There are three	layers
to get to the orb's core

953
01:39:17,730 --> 01:39:20,090
- Did you cut through-?
- We got to the central core

954
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:20,860
- Di cut through?
- We got to the central core.

955
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:23,860
- Where the virus is.
- It was empty.

956
01:39:25,230 --> 01:39:28,590
We analysed the liquid carefully It's water. Only water

957
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,190
What happened to the lights?

958
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,360
Ma'am, our system has been hacked.

959
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:37,330
There's an incoming video call

960
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:38,430
It's Jim.

961
01:39:39,230 --> 01:39:39,730
Connect him

962
01:39:43,730 --> 01:39:46,360
Hello, hello How's everyone?

963
01:39:46,830 --> 01:39:47,830
Was it fun?

964
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,490
Finding only pure distilled mineral water in the orb?

965
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:57,860
Just following my plan in case anyone tried to force the orbs open

966
01:39:58,100 --> 01:39:59,590
The orb has three layers

967
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:01,990
The first layer was empty

968
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:03,590
Only a vacuum.

969
01:40:04,230 --> 01:40:06,430
The seuL.d 'a er a

970
01:40:06,830 --> 01:40:08,990
It contained an invisible corrosive gas

971
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:13,590
It's an acid that melts plastic on contact.

972
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,830
Your plastic suits for example

973
01:40:17,730 --> 01:40:20,230
The third layer contained my superstar

974
01:40:22,830 --> 01:40:23,860
Raktbeej

975
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:26,860
The virus is now all over the lab

976
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:30,860
In the orb's center. you'll find clean safe mineral water

977
01:40:31,230 --> 01:40:34,730
You won't feel thirsty when you're dying

978
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:37,730
You think I'm bluffing?

979
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,430
Look at your pretty white suits

980
01:40:42,330 --> 01:40:44,360
Are they turning black?

981
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:47,430
Your suits are of no use now

982
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:49,860
The virus you were looking for in the water

983
01:40:50,230 --> 01:40:52,590
is invading your whole body.

984
01:40:56,830 --> 01:41:00,590
If pain is measured on a scale of 10.

985
01:41:02,330 --> 01:41:05,060
you'll experience it at 13 or 14.

986
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:07,490
Exciting right?

987
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,360
A demo ofRaktbeej

988
01:41:12,730 --> 01:41:16,860
So please, share your dying moments on Instagram and Twitter

989
01:41:17,230 --> 01:41:20,230
Things that ares n - they sell.

990
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:23,360
Cheers

991
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:27,990
Lock down the lab.

992
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:31,690
Lock the lab!

993
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:32,860
Lock the lab!

994
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,230
All the others, get out’

995
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:36,360
All the others, get u .

996
01:41:36,730 --> 01:41:36,990
others, get out

997
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:38,090
We're sealing the lab.

998
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,990
Get out! Get out all of you

999
01:41:51,860 --> 01:41:55,090
We can decontaminate the atmosphere.

1000
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:56,830
UV radiation, gamma rays.

1001
01:41:57,830 --> 01:41:58,360
But how can you decontaminate us. Luthra?

1002
01:41:59,360 --> 01:41:59,990
But how can you decontaminate us.

1003
01:42:00,830 --> 01:42:02,560
The virus is inside us

1004
01:42:11,830 --> 01:42:12,090
here s only one way.

1005
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:34,360
Very few people get the chance to decide how they'll face their death.

1006
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:38,490
With fear? Hesitation? Or will they panic?

1007
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:45,590
I will not give a bloody terrorist that satisfaction

1008
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:48,190
I'm a soldier

1009
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:50,860
And now,

1010
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:53,490
all of you are too

1011
01:42:55,230 --> 01:42:57,490
Everyone dies someday,

1012
01:42:59,230 --> 01:43:00,990
Today it's our turn

1013
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:06,360
Accept it.

1014
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:27,090
olonel, you know what to do.

1015
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:46,230
Don't save RDX.

1016
01:43:46,930 --> 01:43:48,830
We'll be dead anyway

1017
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,190
Just make sure the virus does not spread

1018
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:57,360
Thank you, everyone.

1019
01:43:58,060 --> 01:44:00,360
It was a great honour serving with you

1020
01:44:01,830 --> 01:44:05,830
You're the molten gold that kept my life together.

1021
01:44:10,430 --> 01:44:11,430
Ma'am...

1022
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,360
You are that gold now Pathaan

1023
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,090
You'll keep everyone together

1024
01:44:22,330 --> 01:44:24,090
and make them strong.

1025
01:44:24,830 --> 01:44:25,690
You were always

1026
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:31,230
the one who kept us together

1027
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:43,690
Get Jim.

1028
01:44:49,330 --> 01:44:51,930
I promise, ma'am.

1029
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:54,990
Make him die a death

1030
01:44:56,230 --> 01:44:58,490
far worse than ours

1031
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:09,830
Ma'am.

1032
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,230
In the name of Lord Shiva!

1033
01:46:18,930 --> 01:46:20,860
Hello, everyone

1034
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:24,190
I know this is a bad time for all of you

1035
01:46:24,930 --> 01:46:26,860
I respect your pain

1036
01:46:27,230 --> 01:46:30,730
So. I'll do my best not to appear
too cheerful

1037
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:32,690
But come on!

1038
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:35,190
It was some Ian1

1039
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:37,690
You should be imorssed

1040
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:39,860
You were an Indian soldier Dammit'

1041
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:43,490
And thanks to you. I'm an
Indian businessman now

1042
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:47,190
If you survive, you might become a client of mine

1043
01:46:47,430 --> 01:46:50,990
Then I'll get you anything you want. Right now. I serve another client

1044
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:52,990
I'm doing what he wants

1045
01:46:53,230 --> 01:46:55,090
Do you even realise what you're doing?

1046
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:57,590
You're unleashing your wrath on humanity

1047
01:46:57,930 --> 01:47:00,230
History will remember you as a monster.

1048
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:02,860
Oh ho' That never occurred to me

1049
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:06,230
What can I do? Everything is ready

1050
01:47:07,830 --> 01:47:11,230
My Saber missile. Armed and TSady

1051
01:47:11,730 --> 01:47:13,360
It's in a location that only I know

1052
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,060
It's in a Io at

1053
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:20,360
An Indian city that only I know

1054
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,360
Such a pity!

1055
01:47:22,830 --> 01:47:27,490
You blew up your lab before you could see what Raktbeej was capable of

1056
01:47:27,860 --> 01:47:31,490
But when it spreads in Delhi Mumbai. Hyderabad or Amritsar

1057
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:34,360
what will you do?

1058
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:36,330
Blow up those cities?

1059
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:37,690
What do you want?

1060
01:47:37,930 --> 01:47:41,230
I want you to negotiate with a terrorist. Colonel Luthra.

1061
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:45,730
You didn't do it for me Now you'll negotiate with me

1062
01:47:46,830 --> 01:47:49,590
What do you want?

1063
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,090
What do you thlhk?

1064
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:54,990
Kashmir

1065
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,090
Obviously. Kashmir

1066
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,230
You have 24 hours

1067
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,930
After 24 hours. if a single soldier

1068
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:12,060
a single tank, a single gun or the Indian flag is seen in Kashmir, then

1069
01:48:12,430 --> 01:48:13,990
That's impossible.

1070
01:48:14,430 --> 01:48:16,730
How can I make that happen in 24 hours?

1071
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:19,430
We need time to think.

1072
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:22,490
Perhaps I used the wrong word that's why you're confus

1073
01:48:23,230 --> 01:48:25,490
This is not a negotiation Colonel Luthra.

1074
01:48:25,730 --> 01:48:27,560
it's an ultimatum

1075
01:48:28,330 --> 01:48:29,830
Your time starts

1076
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:40,930
The situation you're in, the fear that's overcoming, you

1077
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:42,730
I've been there

1078
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:50,230
No one took responsibility for the death of my wife and unborn child.

1079
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:54,360
A now no one is responsible for your death

1080
01:48:56,060 --> 01:48:57,560
How does it feel, guys?

1081
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:01,490
It's not appropriate to say "Jai Hind"

1082
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:05,430
So. take care Time is running out.

1083
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:11,830
Pathaan, you have to stop this madman.

1084
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:18,590
Look! Your innocent family.

1085
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,560
You know what we'll do to them?

1086
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:28,990
Whichever city the missile strikes,
that's where your family will be.

1087
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:32,590
Where is that missile?

1088
01:49:34,730 --> 01:49:37,230
was only to make payment

1089
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:42,590
I said Jim would tell them where to deliver it.

1090
01:49:45,230 --> 01:49:48,490
If you don't know the city, you must know the country.

1091
01:49:49,230 --> 01:49:50,430
Where?

1092
01:49:53,930 --> 01:49:55,360
Afghanistan.

1093
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:00,990
Father!

1094
01:50:30,730 --> 01:50:31,860
I am sorry, Rubai

1095
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:32,990
Fear blinds people

1096
01:50:36,330 --> 01:50:37,590
But you can see

1097
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:40,990
I'm not your contry

1098
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:42,560
I know.

1099
01:50:48,230 --> 01:50:49,490
I shouldn't do this.

1100
01:50:52,860 --> 01:50:53,730
It's wrong.

1101
01:50:54,330 --> 01:50:55,360
I'm sorry.

1102
01:50:56,930 --> 01:50:57,560
Pathaan?

1103
01:50:59,930 --> 01:51:00,230
To you!

1104
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,090
I said sorry.

1105
01:51:23,330 --> 01:51:24,360
All calm, General?

1106
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:26,830
I don't want calm, I want havoc.

1107
01:51:27,860 --> 01:51:29,490
India will not give Kashmir, General.

1108
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:32,730
do we teach them a lesson?

1109
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:39,360
The missile is ready.

1110
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:42,360
You just have to press the button and I have to get paid.

1111
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:44,490
Then boom!

1112
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:52,090
General.

1113
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:59,490
Everyone in my village was struck by a strange disease

1114
01:51:59,700 --> 01:52:01,990
They're all dead now

1115
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:04,490
A metal ball fell here and no one survived after that

1116
01:52:04,830 --> 01:52:06,230
What are they saying?

1117
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:09,330
The video is from an Afghan village, some 200 kms away.

1118
01:52:09,730 --> 01:52:11,590
The local TV is saying

1119
01:52:11,830 --> 01:52:13,730
a strange virus is spreading through the village

1120
01:52:14,330 --> 01:52:16,360
It has the same symptoms as

1121
01:52:18,230 --> 01:52:19,860
smallpox.

1122
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:24,490
That's...

1123
01:52:25,230 --> 01:52:26,330
that's impossible

1124
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:28,590
Raktbeej.

1125
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:32,730
How can it be Raktbeej?

1126
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:35,360
One orb is on the missile,

1127
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:39,330
e other was destroyed in India.

1128
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:41,730
Either you're a fool,

1129
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:45,230
or you think I am.

1130
01:52:46,930 --> 01:52:48,860
If you want all your money,

1131
01:52:49,060 --> 01:52:52,360
find out how this other Raktbeej landed there.

1132
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:00,490
You're mistaken If you think I’m your friend,

1133
01:53:01,830 --> 01:53:04,190
or that I have sympathy towards Pakistan.

1134
01:53:04,700 --> 01:53:06,490
Or that I need money.

1135
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:09,090
You haven't understood me, General.

1136
01:53:10,430 --> 01:53:13,990
I am the demon Raktbeej.

1137
01:53:14,700 --> 01:53:15,560
Leave me!

1138
01:53:15,860 --> 01:53:18,590
If you want to see a free show, why pick on Delhi?

1139
01:53:19,730 --> 01:53:21,330
Change the co-ordinates.

1140
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:25,190
Let's party in Islamabad.

1141
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:28,990
No, sorry. I'm sorry. Don't do that

1142
01:53:33,330 --> 01:53:34,560
You handle it yourself, right?

1143
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,690
Exactly as you told me.

1144
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:41,060
I don't know where it came from.

1145
01:53:43,730 --> 01:53:45,360
Find out what's going on.

1146
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,730
Who's behind this?

1147
01:53:48,730 --> 01:53:50,360
I want the answer,

1148
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,860
and his head.

1149
01:53:54,430 --> 01:53:55,690
want both.

1150
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:27,230
Welcome'

1151
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:36,090
To my home!

1152
01:54:37,860 --> 01:54:39,590
This is my Afghan family.

1153
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:41,860
My people.

1154
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:45,560
Our Pathaan.

1155
01:55:06,830 --> 01:55:07,690
What did you find there?

1156
01:55:08,230 --> 01:55:10,360
The man who stands before you.

1157
01:55:14,330 --> 01:55:15,230
Pathaan.

1158
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:28,360
You have this nasty habit.

1159
01:55:28,930 --> 01:55:31,430
You smell a party and arrive
invited.

1160
01:55:32,930 --> 01:55:36,330
Never ever invited to a bash, Pathaan just loves to gatecrash

1161
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:39,560
If you have a party
- in Pathaan's home

1162
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:46,490
With some fireworks

1163
01:55:47,930 --> 01:55:49,190
Some joke, General!

1164
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,230
Another of your agents has fallen in love with the enemy.

1165
01:55:55,830 --> 01:55:57,990
First there was Zoya and Tiger.

1166
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:00,330
And now...

1167
01:56:05,730 --> 01:56:11,230
Has ISI turned into some dating website for Indian agents?

1168
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:26,730
Pathaan!

1169
01:56:31,730 --> 01:56:32,230
- Raza.
- Pathaan.

1170
01:56:32,730 --> 01:56:34,090
- Raza.
- Pathaan.

1171
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:49,490
Pathaan, Jim isn't a man to give up

1172
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:50,560
There must be

1173
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,090
e must be

1174
01:56:58,860 --> 01:57:00,490
Amol, see if the orb can be detached from the missile

1175
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:01,860
Amol see if the orb can be d from the missile.

1176
01:57:02,230 --> 01:57:03,230
-	Yes sir
-	Duck

1177
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:11,360
I'll deactivate the missile

1178
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:05,990
Where's the orb?

1179
02:01:06,230 --> 02:01:08,930
Pathaan, the missile was only a diversion

1180
02:01:09,230 --> 02:01:10,860
The real Raktbeej isn't here

1181
02:01:50,500 --> 02:01:52,990
Where is Raktbeej? What is Jim's real plan?

1182
02:01:53,100 --> 02:01:54,860
You traitor, I will...

1183
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:58,860
Wait! Only Sergei knows.

1184
02:01:59,230 --> 02:02:00,090
Sergei.

1185
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:19,360
Flight LT-72.

1186
02:02:28,730 --> 02:02:31,360
Pathaan and Colonel Luthra listen to me

1187
02:02:31,730 --> 02:02:32,990
Raktbeej is on a plane

1188
02:02:33,730 --> 02:02:36,360
Flight LT-72. It's circling Delhi right now.

1189
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:40,860
If the orb can be deactivated,

1190
02:02:42,930 --> 02:02:44,860
me to air traffic control Now!

1191
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,090
Pathaan find Jim

1192
02:03:09,700 --> 02:03:11,560
Flight LT-72, do you hear me?

1193
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:15,190
Ground Air Control, this is Captain Mehra from Flight LT-72.

1194
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:18,490
Landing permission denied.
I repeat, landin permission denied.

1195
02:03:18,700 --> 02:03:19,560
What?

1196
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:30,560
Raktbeej is sitting happily in a plane over Delhi now.

1197
02:03:32,860 --> 02:03:34,690
The orb has six minutes left

1198
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:38,590
And so does Delhi

1199
02:03:40,230 --> 02:03:41,730
In six
ni

1200
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,990
will spread through the plane's AC ducts

1201
02:03:49,730 --> 02:03:51,730
you can grab this detonator switch

1202
02:03:54,600 --> 02:03:55,430
What a pity!

1203
02:03:57,730 --> 02:03:58,590
It's unlikely

1204
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:08,590
Captain Mehra, this is Colonel Luthra from RAW

1205
02:04:08,830 --> 02:04:10,590
There's a biological weapon on board

1206
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,860
The devie is in your AC ducts

1207
02:04:13,230 --> 02:04:13,990
What?

1208
02:04:14,730 --> 02:04:17,730
What am I supposed to do, Colonel? We're running low on fuel.

1209
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:20,190
Captain, you're carrying a very dangerous weapon.

1210
02:04:20,600 --> 02:04:22,990
Fly as far as you can from Delhi, please.

1211
02:05:09,860 --> 02:05:11,060
I found it, Colonel.

1212
02:05:12,060 --> 02:05:14,230
Only four minutes to go.

1213
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:17,830
Get me the minister.

1214
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:44,830
Yes, sir.

1215
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:46,930
There is no other option.

1216
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:49,360
Jai Hind.

1217
02:05:50,430 --> 02:05:51,990
- Connect me to missile command
- Yes, sir

1218
02:06:24,930 --> 02:06:26,330
Captain, we will have to destroy the plane.

1219
02:06:26,600 --> 02:06:28,730
There must be another way, Colonel.

1220
02:06:29,700 --> 02:06:33,730
I have 300 passengers
and many children on board.

1221
02:06:36,730 --> 02:06:39,990
Right now, your plane is more dangerous than a nuclear bomb.

1222
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:43,490
I’m sorry. We...can't save you

1223
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:54,090
Missile control, intiate strike protocol

1224
02:07:01,060 --> 02:07:02,330
Come on, Pathaan

1225
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:06,090
There's only one option.

1226
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:07,990
Remember how you sacrificed your scientists?

1227
02:07:09,100 --> 02:07:11,490
Play "Vande Mataram" on the plane

1228
02:07:11,860 --> 02:07:13,230
and blow up the passengers.

1229
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:14,330
Fire.

1230
02:07:19,560 --> 02:07:23,360
My family's lives were sacrificed, Now it's your turn to make a sacrifice.

1231
02:08:43,100 --> 02:08:44,860
Farewell, Pathaan.

1232
02:09:05,830 --> 02:09:08,490
The timer has stopped, sir Please stop the missile

1233
02:09:08,600 --> 02:09:10,190
Abort, abort, abort!

1234
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:23,560
Ladies and gentlemen this is your Captain here

1235
02:09:23,730 --> 02:09:26,590
Please buckle up because we're about to land in Delhi

1236
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:10,430
You couldn't understand something very simple.

1237
02:10:12,360 --> 02:10:14,430
A soldier does not ask

1238
02:10:15,230 --> 02:10:17,090
what his country can do for him.

1239
02:10:19,230 --> 02:10:19,730
He asks

1240
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,330
what he can do for his cou

1241
02:10:38,730 --> 02:10:40,590
You don't deserve this Jim

1242
02:10:53,060 --> 02:10:56,330
Give your Mother India my last goodbye.

1243
02:11:01,230 --> 02:11:02,860
Jai Hind

1244
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:19,090
If anyone merits this medal, it's you

1245
02:12:20,100 --> 02:12:23,330
I've never met a braver soldier than you

1246
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:27,590
Ma' am

1247
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:29,690
Pathaan.

1248
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,730
Colonel, good news.

1249
02:12:34,060 --> 02:12:35,190
I'm leaving.

1250
02:12:35,500 --> 02:12:38,830
So you won't suffer from acidity and blood pressure anymore

1251
02:12:39,330 --> 02:12:42,490
Our paths are separate now.

1252
02:12:43,060 --> 02:12:45,330
-Thankyou, sir
- The war is not over, Pathaan.

1253
02:12:47,100 --> 02:12:49,230
-We need you.
- Me

1254
02:12:50,230 --> 02:12:54,060
But we are... what did you call us? Broken eggshells'?

1255
02:12:54,360 --> 02:12:56,230
I admit mistakes were made, Pathaan.

1256
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:01,490
But this country cannot be saved by Colonel Luthra alone.

1257
02:13:02,330 --> 02:13:05,360
Or by Tiger or Kabir.

1258
02:13:07,430 --> 02:13:08,590
Or even by Pathaan.

1259
02:13:09,600 --> 02:13:10,930
Everyone is needed

1260
02:13:14,360 --> 02:13:16,930
There are many soldiers like them, Pathaan.

1261
02:13:18,930 --> 02:13:20,590
Some with wounded bodies, others with damaged souls.

1262
02:13:21,500 --> 02:13:26,090
But they are ready to sacrifice their lives for this country.

1263
02:13:26,860 --> 02:13:30,860
These broken folk can only be put together with the gold

1264
02:13:33,560 --> 02:13:35,360
that has lived through fire.

1265
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:39,860
And that person is you.

1266
02:13:41,330 --> 02:13:44,360
Make the sharpest sword, Pathaan,

1267
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:48,230
so the souls' of the enemy tremble.

1268
02:13:50,230 --> 02:13:52,330
But who will wield that sword?
