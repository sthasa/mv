-I want you.

1603
01:51:12,728 --> 01:51:14,093
AIways.

1604
01:51:19,669 --> 01:51:22,263
I'm not gonna end your Iife for you.

1605
01:51:22,338 --> 01:51:24,829
I'm dying already.

1606
01:51:26,742 --> 01:51:28,972
Every second, I get closer.

1607
01:51:29,612 --> 01:51:30,943
OIder.

1608
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:33,971
That's the way it's supposed to be.

1609
01:51:34,884 --> 01:51:37,375
AIice said that she saw me Iike you.

1610
01:51:37,453 --> 01:51:39,785
-I heard her.
-Her visions change.

1611
01:51:39,855 --> 01:51:42,346
Yeah, based on what people decide.

1612
01:51:43,092 --> 01:51:44,684
I've decided.

1613
01:51:48,064 --> 01:51:50,555
So that's what you dream about.

1614
01:51:50,633 --> 01:51:52,430
Becoming a monster.

1615
01:51:55,972 --> 01:51:58,873
I dream about being with you forever.

1616
01:51:58,941 --> 01:52:00,272
Forever?

1617
01:52:05,414 --> 01:52:07,541
And you're ready right now?

1618
01:52:09,585 --> 01:52:10,779
Yes.

1619
01:52:10,853 --> 01:52:17,816
Bleeding or lost you

1620
01:52:17,893 --> 01:52:22,455
American mouth

1621
01:52:22,531 --> 01:52:27,764
Big pill

1622
01:52:27,837 --> 01:52:32,331
Is it not enough
just to have a Iong and happy Iife with me?

1623
01:52:39,949 --> 01:52:41,211
Yeah.

1624
01:52:42,651 --> 01:52:44,016
For now.

1625
01:53:12,548 --> 01:53:14,914
BELLA: No one will surrender tonight,

1626
01:53:16,018 --> 01:53:17,883
but i won't give in.

1627
01:53:19,188 --> 01:53:21,088
i know what i want.

1628
01:53:27,163 --> 01:53:32,260
Have i found you

1629
01:53:32,334 --> 01:53:36,862
Flightless bird

1630
01:53:36,939 --> 01:53:41,535
Grounded

1631
01:53:41,610 --> 01:53:48,573
Bleeding or lost you

1632
01:53:52,354 --> 01:53:54,549
American mouth

1633
01:54:03,766 --> 01:54:06,963
(SiNGiNG) How come i end up where i started

1634
01:54:07,036 --> 01:54:10,062
How come i end up where i went wrong

1635
01:54:10,139 --> 01:54:13,336
Won't take my eyes off the ball again

1636
01:54:13,409 --> 01:54:16,606
You reel me out then you cut the string

1637
01:54:22,785 --> 01:54:25,879
How come i end up where i started

1638
01:54:25,955 --> 01:54:28,924
How come i end up where i went wrong

1639
01:54:28,991 --> 01:54:31,926
Won't take my eyes off the ball again

1640
01:54:31,994 --> 01:54:35,828
First you reel me out
and then you cut the string

1641
01:54:47,877 --> 01:54:51,074
You used to be all right

1642
01:54:51,147 --> 01:54:53,809
What happened?

1643
01:54:53,883 --> 01:55:00,152
Did the cat get your tongue

1644
01:55:00,222 --> 01:55:06,991
Did your string come undone

1645
01:55:07,062 --> 01:55:13,297
One by one

1646
01:55:13,369 --> 01:55:18,739
One by one

1647
01:55:18,807 --> 01:55:25,337
it comes to us all

1648
01:55:25,414 --> 01:55:32,320
it's as soft as your pillow

1649
01:56:15,831 --> 01:56:18,459
(SiNGiNG) i dreamed i was missing

1650
01:56:18,534 --> 01:56:21,594
You were so scared

1651
01:56:21,670 --> 01:56:24,434
But no one would listen

1652
01:56:24,506 --> 01:56:27,942
'Cause no one else cared

1653
01:56:28,010 --> 01:56:30,501
After my dreaming

1654
01:56:30,579 --> 01:56:33,946
i woke with this fear

1655
01:56:34,016 --> 01:56:36,416
What am i leaving

1656
01:56:36,485 --> 01:56:39,613
When i'm done here?

1657
01:56:39,688 --> 01:56:42,122
So if you're asking me

1658
01:56:42,191 --> 01:56:46,025
i want you to know

1659
01:56:46,095 --> 01:56:48,154
When my time comes

1660
01:56:48,230 --> 01:56:51,324
Forget the wrong that i've done

1661
01:56:51,400 --> 01:56:54,198
Help me leave behind some

1662
01:56:54,270 --> 01:56:58,036
Reasons to be missed

1663
01:56:58,107 --> 01:57:00,234
Don't resent me

1664
01:57:00,309 --> 01:57:03,244
And when you're feeling empty

1665
01:57:03,312 --> 01:57:06,179
Keep me in your memory

1666
01:57:06,248 --> 01:57:09,342
Leave out all the rest

1667
01:57:09,418 --> 01:57:11,943
Leave out all the rest

1668
01:57:12,021 --> 01:57:14,888
Forgetting all the hurt inside

1669
01:57:14,957 --> 01:57:17,892
You've learned to hide so well

1670
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:20,793
Pretending someone else can come

1671
01:57:20,863 --> 01:57:23,923
And save me from myself

1672
01:57:23,999 --> 01:57:27,992
i can't be who you are

1673
01:57:28,070 --> 01:57:30,163
When my time comes

1674
01:57:30,239 --> 01:57:33,265
Forget the wrong that i've done

1675
01:57:33,342 --> 01:57:36,311
Help me leave behind some

1676
01:57:36,378 --> 01:57:40,041
Reasons to be missed

1677
01:57:40,115 --> 01:57:42,083
Don't resent me

1678
01:57:42,151 --> 01:57:45,279
And when you're feeling empty

1679
01:57:45,354 --> 01:57:48,016
Keep me in your memory

1680
01:57:48,090 --> 01:57:51,287
Leave out all the rest

1681
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:53,920
Leave out all the rest

1682
01:57:53,996 --> 01:57:56,760
Forgetting all the hurt inside

1683
01:57:56,832 --> 01:57:59,892
You've learned to hide so well

1684
01:57:59,968 --> 01:58:02,664
Pretending someone else can come

1685
01:58:02,738 --> 01:58:05,935
And save me from myself

1686
01:58:06,008 --> 01:58:11,878
i can't be who you are

1687
01:58:11,947 --> 01:58:16,384
i can't be who you are

1688
01:58:24,293 --> 01:58:27,126
(SiNGiNG) How can i decide what's right

1689
01:58:27,196 --> 01:58:30,393
When you're clouding up my mind

1690
01:58:30,466 --> 01:58:33,629
i can't win your losing fight

1691
01:58:33,702 --> 01:58:35,693
All the time

1692
01:58:35,771 --> 01:58:38,865
How can i ever own what's mine

1693
01:58:38,941 --> 01:58:41,967
When you're always taking sides

1694
01:58:42,044 --> 01:58:44,979
But you won't take away my pride

1695
01:58:45,047 --> 01:58:51,282
No, not this time

1696
01:58:51,353 --> 01:58:58,316
No, not this time

1697
01:58:59,094 --> 01:59:01,756
How did we get here?

1698
01:59:01,830 --> 01:59:08,793
When i used to know you so well

1699
01:59:10,739 --> 01:59:13,640
But how did we get here?

1700
01:59:13,709 --> 01:59:20,638
i think i know

1701
01:59:28,524 --> 01:59:31,652
The truth is hiding in your eyes

1702
01:59:31,727 --> 01:59:34,787
And its hanging on your tongue

1703
01:59:34,863 --> 01:59:37,229
Just boiling in my blood

1704
01:59:37,299 --> 01:59:39,961
But you think that i can't see

1705
01:59:40,035 --> 01:59:43,334
What kind of man that you are

1706
01:59:43,405 --> 01:59:46,431
if you're a man at all

1707
01:59:46,508 --> 01:59:53,414
Well, i will figure this one out on my own

1708
01:59:54,850 --> 02:00:00,288
i'm screaming i love you so

1709
02:00:00,355 --> 02:00:03,290
My thoughts you can't decode

1710
02:00:03,358 --> 02:00:06,293
How did we get here?

1711
02:00:06,361 --> 02:00:13,324
When i used to know you so well

1712
02:00:13,402 --> 02:00:17,668
Yeah
But how did we get here?

1713
02:00:17,739 --> 02:00:24,702
Well, i think i know how

1714
02:00:37,192 --> 02:00:42,858
Do you see what we've done

1715
02:00:42,931 --> 02:00:48,733
We're gonna make such fools of ourselves

1716
02:00:50,239 --> 02:00:53,106
How did we get here?

1717
02:00:53,175 --> 02:00:57,737
When i used to know you so well

1718
02:00:57,813 --> 02:01:01,772
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1719
02:01:01,850 --> 02:01:04,717
How did we get here?

1720
02:01:04,786 --> 02:01:11,749
When i used to know you so well

1721
02:01:11,827 --> 02:01:15,991
i think i know

1722
02:01:19,234 --> 02:01:25,036
There is something i see in you

1723
02:01:25,107 --> 02:01:27,803
it might kill me

1724
02:01:27,876 --> 02:01:34,213
i want it to be true



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
